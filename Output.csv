 B003AI2VGA, A141HP4LYPWMSR, Brian E. Erland "Rainbow Sphinx", 7/7, 3.0, 1182729600, "There Is So Much Darkness Now ~ Come For The Miracle", Synopsis: On the daily trek from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert. Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.<br /><br />Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the "Wounds of Christ" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.<br /><br />Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.<br /><br />`Virgin of Juarez' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).
 B003AI2VGA, A328S9RN3U5M68, Grady Harp, 4/4, 3.0, 1181952000, Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production, THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez, Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso, Texas.  The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light, but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director.<br /><br />Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple (in the hundreds) killings of young women. The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work, raped, beaten and killed.  Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies, in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US.  She meets Father Herrera (Esai Morales) and a community activist Patrick (Angus MacFadyen) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder, discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talanc&oacute;n), a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary.  A father of one of the victims, Isidro (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital, placing her in a 'church' where she becomes a 'saint' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end.  Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims' families.  Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators, taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men' from the police office of Detective Lauro (Jacob Vargas), and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez. Fearing for Mariela's life, they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story.<br /><br />The squeaky, mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson.  Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism, the story would possibly have been better related.  There are some good performances by Driver, Talanc&oacute;n, Morales, and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality.  Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema.  It is sad when script and the production dull the impact.  Grady Harp, June 07
 B003AI2VGA, A1I7QGUDP043DG, Chrissy K. McVay "Writer", 8/10, 5.0, 1164844800, This movie needed to be made., The scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic re-enactment of real events, but this story needs to be told. I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences 'stigmata' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it's never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
 B003AI2VGA, A1M5405JH9THP9, golgotha.gov, 1/1, 3.0, 1197158400, distantly based on a real tragedy, THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ (2006)<br />directed by Kevin James Dobson<br />approx. 1 hour 25 minutes<br /><br />The town of Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico is just across the border from El Paso, Texas.  It is home to several factories owned by American companies who employ Mexicans at very low wages.  Since the early 1990s, Juarez has also been the murder site of hundreds of women.  There is a lot of debate as to whether the deaths are the work of a drug gang or a serial killer.  It has also been suggested that due to the local police department's failure to solve the crimes, new rapists and thugs have moved to the area knowing that they will never be caught.  The situation is an overwhelming tragedy and this movie uses the story as a backdrop.<br /><br />We start off seeing how unsafe women feel as they walk and work in Juarez.  Then we meet the hard-headed American journalist played by Minnie Driver.  She aggressively questions the local police and befriends a Catholic priest.  Within the first twenty minutes or so, we see the terrifying reality of the situation in Juarez.<br /><br />At this point, the story jumps from something that might have happened to something that is only found in this movie.  A woman named Mariela survives an brutal attack but is in critical condition in a small hospital.  While the priest is speaking to her, she lets out a howl... and her hands begin bleeding*.  This "stigmata" is meant to show that she has been blessed by the Virgin Mary.  Our reporter protagonist clashes with various authorities on what should be done.  Meanwhile Mariela goes underground and attracts a devoted following, eventually landing her own radio show (!) and living under the protection of gang members, whom she refers to as "modern warriors".  The only thing missing is "Jes&uacute;s Malverde".<br /><br />Now I understand that we don't know everything about the Juarez murders and that a screenwriter has to "fill in the blanks" when crafting an exciting dramatization.  However if you are going to deviate so far from the true story, then don't preface your movie as being "based on the ongoing unsolved murders in Cuidad Juarez".  There is plenty of interesting and legitimate information in the REAL stories of Juarez and there is no need to fabricate.  This movie may "raise the issue" of the Juarez women, but it isn't really about them at all!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the killings in Juarez, there are a few documentaries.  A recent one from Las Perlas Del Mar Films is simply titled 'JUAREZ' and is a good introduction.  Zulma Aguiar's 'JUAREZ MOTHERS FIGHT FEMICIDE' (focuses on the families) is also easy to find.  There is another one which I haven't seen titled 'BORDER ECHOES'.<br /><br />*- note to Hollywood:<br />the nails that crucified Jesus were through his wrists, not his palms!
 B003AI2VGA, ATXL536YX71TR, KerrLines "&#34;Movies,Music,Theatre&#34;", 1/1, 3.0, 1188345600, "What's going on down in Juarez and shining a light on it", Informationally, this SHOWTIME original is essential viewing for enlightening audiences on the dangerous plight of women migrant workers from Los Angeles who are routinely and mysteriously murdered on the border between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas.Since 1993, hundreds of woman have turned up dead and mutilated and no one seems to either care or have an answer. The fear and death continue.<br /><br />Director Kevin Dobson has brought us Michael Fallon's screenplay THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ to the screen as a fanciful/possible solution to what may be happening down in Juarez.Though this is but a film, the information about the unsolved murders and the religious fanaticism in the area is crucial.<br /><br />Suggested companion film would be AGNES OF GOD.
 B003AI2VGA, A3QYDL5CDNYN66, abra "a devoted reader", 0/0, 2.0, 1229040000, Pretty pointless fictionalization, The murders in Juarez are real. This movie is a badly acted fantasy of revenge and holy intercession.  If there is a good movie about Juarez, I don't know what it is, but it is not this one.
 B003AI2VGA, AQJVNDW6YZFQS, Charles R. Williams, 3/11, 1.0, 1164153600, This is junk, stay away, Mexican men are macho rapists, gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats. Mexican women are semi-pagan, pious fools. There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy, culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter.<br /><br />The story is absurd, the characters are unbelievable, the stereotypes are offensive.
 B00006HAXW, AD4CDZK7D31XP, Anthony Accordino, 64/65, 5.0, 1060473600, A  Rock N Roll History Lesson, Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage &quot;Doo Wop&quot;  and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.
 B00006HAXW, A3Q4S5DFVPB70D, Joseph P. Aiello, 26/26, 5.0, 1041292800, A  MUST-HAVE  video if you grew up in the 50's or 60's, I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It's the best "Oldies" video I've ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60's, and they're still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews.
 B00006HAXW, A2P7UB02HAVEPB, "bruce_from_la", 24/24, 5.0, 1061164800, If You Like DooWop You Gotta Have This DVD, Wow! When I saw this show on PBS--that was it, I had to have this!  What great tunes!  And seeing these groups--terrific! I couldn't find a list of songs, so here's some of them: Keep-a-Knockin--Little Richard; Sea Cruise--Frankie Ford; A Thousand Stars--Kathi Young (still cute!) and the Innocents; Silhouettes by the Rays; Do You Love Me--The Contours; Have You Heard--The Duprees; over 40 songs in all, including Little Anthony, The Five Satins, Lloyd Price, The Skyliners, The Fleetwoods, Jay &amp; the Americans (This Magic Moment, Cara Mia and Come a Little Bit Closer!); Lou Christie; plus Franki Valli and Jerry Butler as hosts. Plus interviews with Kathi Young, Lou Christie and the producer TJ Lubinski (thanks TJ!)
 B00006HAXW, A2TX99AZKDK0V7, Henrique Peirano, 22/23, 4.0, 1039564800, I expected more., I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs, and was anxiously waiting for Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive. From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It's simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they're a wonderful experience for all ages.
 B00006HAXW, AFC8IKR407HSK, Richard Albero, 14/14, 5.0, 1045526400, Professional Excellence, Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD's you will ever see. It is done with class and a great respect for the talent. Congratulations to T.J. Lubinsky the producer. Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today. the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on &quot;Two Kinds of People In The World&quot; is worth the price alone. I have played this piece over and over. All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through.
 B00006HAXW, A1FRPGQYQTAOR1, Les, 9/9, 5.0, 1062979200, Marvelous, just Marvelous!, The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all! It is just great! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there. After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51. What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past! You will never regret buying this DVD.
 B00006HAXW, A1RSDE90N6RSZF, Joseph M. Kotow, 9/9, 5.0, 1042502400, Pittsburgh - Home of the OLDIES, I have all of the doo wop DVD's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones. Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again. Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE this DVD !!
 B00006HAXW, A1OUBOGB5970AO, "fellafromnyc", 7/7, 4.0, 1049846400, They sang in the subway, in halls.., The performance of Little Anthony and the Imperials singing &quot;Two Kinds of People&quot; acappella is worth the price of admission; they haven't lost a step!  The rest is simply gravy.
 B00006HAXW, A3NPHQVIY59Y0Y, S. Dorman, 7/7, 5.0, 1047945600, DOO WOP RECORDED HISTORY- A MUST HAVE ITEM, Get it, also get Dop Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51. Each performances is like the original 45's, except with modern, nice ,crisp sound like today's cds.
 B00006HAXW, AFKMBAY28XO8A, RFP, 7/7, 5.0, 1038787200, ROCK RYTHM AND DOOWOP, Excellent, excellent performers.  Excellent video and audio quality.  Buy this DVD and go back in time.  Well worth the time waiting for almost a year to get hold of the DVD.
 B00006HAXW, A66KMXH9V7OGU, C. Thomas, 4/4, 5.0, 1177804800, Unbelievable Best Concert!, This video is awesome and of particular interest to anyone who grew up with the great music of the 50's and 60's.  The Duprees were wonderful!  Also, Jay Black's Cara Mia gave me goose bumps.  It doesn't matter how old these guys are, they can still belt out quite a song.  Little Anthony and the Imperials were also very, very good!  They have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it!  The backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise. This is one you do not want to miss!  I recommend it HIGHLY!
 B00006HAXW, AFJ27ZV9183B8, Michael A. Martin, 3/3, 5.0, 1200096000, Another outstanding performance and concert., As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br />Keep A Knocking - Little Richard<br />Sea Cruise - Frankie Ford<br />A Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the Innocents<br />Silhouettes - The Rays<br />Do You Love Me - Contours<br />Have You Heard and You Belong to Me - Duprees<br />Peppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the Starlighters<br />For Your Love - Ed Townsend<br />Romeo and Juliet - Reflections<br />Lightning Strikes - Lou Christie<br />Tears on My Pillow, Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop, Two Kins of People in the World, Hurt So Bad, and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the Imperials<br />Since I Fell for You - Lenny Welch<br />Tossing and Turning - Bobby Lewis<br />Mr. Blue and Come Softly to Me - Fleetwoods<br />Remember Then and I Believe - Larry Chance and the Earls<br />Daddy's Home - Shep and the Limelighters<br />This Magic Moment and Cara Mia - Jay Black and the Americans<br />He Don't Love You (Like I Love You) - Jerry Butler and Pure Gold<br />Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price<br />Once in a While -  Chimes<br />Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - Casinos<br />To the Aisle and In the Still of the Night - Fred Parris and the Satins<br />Let's Hang On - Frankie Valli and cast (end credits)<br />Bonus tracks (can be viewed in any order):<br />Never - Earls<br />My Own True Love -  Duprees<br />Come a Little Bit Closer - Jay Black and the Americans<br />First I Look at the Purse - Contours.
 B00006HAXW, AXMKAXC0TR9AW, C. W. Emblom "Bill Emblom", 5/6, 5.0, 1082592000, Outstanding Whether It Is Either On VHS Or DVD, I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD's and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren't available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn't have.
 B00004CQT3, A34KFDQ5KBHZA5, steven conklin, 18/19, 5.0, 1070064000, far from home: the adventures of yellow dog, well,this just goes to show why you don't blindly accept a critics review. I own a yellow lab(2) and I can tell you this is a pretty realistic. Yes I guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but I dont think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attack(would have been fatal if not for yellows actions). It is a very heartwarming  story without being predictable and just fantastic views. The heck with critics. Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing.
 B00004CQT3, A1CIW2OEVAJRM2, Godly Gadfly, 14/15, 5.0, 1092441600, Spectacular and suspenseful family film!, The cover of our DVD of "Far From Home" says in large letters: "Family Feature".  And a great family movie it is.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named "Yellow".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father's ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.<br /><br />Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, "Far From Home" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.<br /><br />Although the movie is "clean", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it's hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY
 B00004CQT3, A1VJCDRXUQVXBM, K. Kangley, 10/11, 5.0, 964915200, A truly wonderful family film, I would beg to differ with the above description of the film. This is not the typical &quot;A-boy-and-his-pet&quot; film. The story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as &quot;Flipper&quot; or  &quot;Lassie&quot; and lacks the obvious manipulations of an &quot;Air  Bud.&quot; The characters look like real people. (Watch how Angus' little  brother dresses himself. Anyone who has been around a six-year old can see  their child dressing like this). Angus's and Yellow's fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or &quot;Disneyfied.&quot; The  cinematography is beautiful. This film is wonderful for the whole family,  not just for the six-year old.
 B00004CQT3, A2IMLPUXYQJTSY, Jerry Loveless "jerryl3515", 7/7, 5.0, 1146960000, Excellent Family Movie, As owners of a Yellow Lab, we just might be a bit biased, but we were mesmerized by this movie.<br /><br />The adventures of a lost boy and dog.  Of course the ending is predictable.  We knew that.  But the story line, the fabulous scenery, the cinematography, the acting, the sub-plots and the adventure make this a must-see movie for the whole family - Preview it before showing it to the very young; they might be traumatized by the scary parts.<br /><br />Buy "Far From Home..."  a guaranteed winner.  You'll be watching it over and over again.
 B00004CQT3, A1D12NAC1U12F0, Frank J. Pickens "Blade", 4/4, 5.0, 1154304000, Awesome Dog Movie, You don't have to own a Yellow Lab to absolutley love this movie, but true dog lovers will find it irrestible. A young boy takes in a lost Yellow lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.<br /><br /> After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.
 B00004CQT3, A3RVH9HUN9J4LZ, Michael, 1/1, 5.0, 1248825600, A movie for all ages, You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from start to finish.  On par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3A">The Journey of Natty Gann</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ZXSI">A Walk in the Clouds</a>.
 B00004CQT3, AH7ZNGM8WOOGN, Gary E. Hogan "GEH", 1/1, 5.0, 1179792000, Great American Movie, This is by far one of the best American Movies, that I have seen in a very long time. It was indeed a true American reality show.
 B00004CQT3, A2582KMXLK2P06, B. E Jackson, 0/0, 3.0, 1323043200, uh oh, I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.<br /><br />The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.<br /><br />I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.<br /><br />Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.<br /><br />Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes over the ocean first.<br /><br />If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.<br /><br />The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.<br /><br />Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one.

Then Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog, is the movie for you! This movie tells the story of a young boy named Angus who adopts a stray dog and names him Yellow. Angus, his father, and Yellow set sail one day, but a huge storm causes their boat to topple. Rescue teams are only able to find Angus' father. Stranded on an island far from civilization, Angus and Yellow's survival skills are put to the test. Will they get rescued? Watch this movie to find out! I liked this movie because it is a heartwarming tale. The movie builds anticipation in the rescue team's pursuit to find Angus and Yellow. I was especially impressed with Yellow's acting! His facial expressions and actions resemble that of a person's. I recommend this film for children ages 7 and up. The movie is an uplifting journey and is a splendid family film. Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog is one of the many classics brought to your home by HDnet movies on KidScene, a morning and Friday night programming block specifically for kids and families.

Dog, he names Yellow, becomes boys best friend.  A functional family teaching their son responsibility.  The scenery in this movie is beautiful. You will laugh, smile, and have tears....ending with joy.  Years ago we purchased this movie for ourselves after seeing it on HBO.  We have since purchased it for adults and for children.

Now as a 29 year old guy I find this film just as entertaining as I did all those years ago. In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films.

 B00004CQT3, A2I6MHMAZZDCRX, Mark Baker, 0/0, 3.0, 1222819200, A Boy and His Dog Fight to Survive, Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, young Angus McCormick (Jesse Bradford) has learned many survival skills.  He's just finishing up a nice canoe.  And when he finds a stray dog, he adopts him and names him Yellow.<br /><br />Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad, John (Bruce Davison), on a supply run seems like a dream come true.  But when they encounter a fierce storm, the boat they are in capsizes.  John is quickly rescued, but the search and rescue teams can't find any trace of Angus or Yellow.<br /><br />The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization.  Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family?<br /><br />This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare.  It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.<br /><br />The film could have been much better but does grow on you.  Don't rush out to see it, but there's no reason to avoid it either.

Syrett "grandma-vicki", 3/5, 5.0, 997315200, Far From Home: Adventures of Yellow Dog, I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out.  It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion.  Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending (of Course).  I am Disney's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others. (P.S.  I am a Grandmother to eleven.)  Thank heavens for Disney Movies.
 B00004CQT3, A11L5M4MJP00UW, David L Hutchins "Music Lover", 2/6, 3.0, 1168473600, Disappointing, I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film.  Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials.
 B00004CQT3, A2VDM3D712BGLE, Elizabeth LaRosa, 1/5, 1.0, 1262304000, Truly bad but not the worst, This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting wasn't good, it was very predictable, and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary. The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. "Far From Home" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole "romance" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued. All in all, I would not advise anyone to see this movie; in fact, I would warn against it.

Plus, Dennis Leary is great and "Duff" from MTV (VJ around 1990-91) also makes a cameo.....very cute! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh.<br /><br />MJ

Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are a great pair, very funny.  Dennis Leary is hysterical.  So many quotable quotes!  The parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie. It's not a serious movie, more like really long funny skit.

 B0078V2LCY, A27H9DOUGY9FOS, K. Harris "Film aficionado", 1/1, 3.0, 1327968000, A Lavish Chinese Production That Ends Up Being A Soapy (And Pretty Loopy) Revenge Drama, I had heard a lot of criticism leveled at Gao Xiaosong's "My Kingdom" complaining that its two disparate halves never really fit together into a cohesive narrative. The first part of the film strains for epic grandeur with its story of two orphans being trained in the art and honor of the Chinese opera (not the singing kind). One of the boys sees his family slaughtered in a political maneuver but is saved from imminent death by a wandering opera master and his charge. The three form a offbeat family unit which is threatened when their master is humiliated in a challenge with a Southern rival. The movie fast forwards until the boys are grown and ready to seek a form of retribution as they move into the popular Shanghai opera scene in the twenties. After this simple story is resolved, the second half of the film becomes a loopy bit of revenge fantasy. The screenplay twists and turns as secrets are revealed, implausibilities mount up, and characters have their ulterior motives exposed. It is chaotic (and tries way too hard), but at least it's fun.<br /><br />Many who have unfavorably judged "My Kingdom" tend to proclaim the first half as brilliant and the second half as the weak link. I, however, tend to disagree. I thought that the introductory premise was so thin and contrived that I never bought into the dramatic substance of the plot. Heck, two seconds after the boys arrive in Shanghai, they are greeted by a street parade extolling an upcoming performance of the man who bested their adoptive father 15 years previously. Hey, that was simple. These two vagabonds issue a challenge to the opera superstar that somehow gets newspaper coverage and makes them headliners in a opera duel. Hey, that was simple too. Now they are legends! Wow, that's a lot for their first day in town! After the duel, the boys must integrate themselves within the existing opera company that includes a defiant leading lady. As one steps into the spotlight and an illicit affair, the other seeks to avenge his family's murder from so many years ago. The remainder of the film plays as a twisty thriller that never feels particularly real. But as the convoluted plotting wraps around itself, I must admit to being amused by it all. It, for me, was far more entertaining than what had preceded it.<br /><br />The movie itself is elaborately staged. The battle sequences and opera numbers have a pleasing over-the-top quality. 1920's Shanghai is lush and gorgeous and the costuming is memorable. However, it all feels a little flat. The leads are attractive enough, but they lack a gravitas to convince us they can headline an intended epic. I understand they are known pop stars in their country, and that makes sense. The actor who plays a diabolical police investigator seems like he's about twelve and downplays the drama out of every scene. Ultimately, I think "My Kingdom" tries to accomplish too much. I personally wish they would have committed to making it an adult soap opera with no pretensions other than to entertain. As is, it's a bit of a mess. I probably liked it for the wrong reasons, but its loopiness is not without its charms. KGHarris, 1/12.

The only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons.  I already bought the show in HD via Xbox Live.  Glad to see it on Amazon.com VOD.  I would have bought from here first if it was available at the time.  Wish show would come out on Blu-ray.  Season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment.  Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode. Enjoy.
 B004BH1TN0, AWPODHOB4GFWL, Martin A Hogan "Marty From SF", 34/35, 5.0, 1012003200, As Crisp As A Live Recording Can Be, Recording with an audience of less than 1,000, this DVD feels like a club recording with it's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound.  Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request' gimmick is not original.  Still, it manages to captivate.  Fifteen songs (one a medley of eight), five being from the last album, it's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies.  &quot;She Keep On Coming&quot; and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot; rock the house, while &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; lull the audience into a trance.  This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins' and lots of joking around.  Its surprising to hear Barry sing, &quot;Woman In Love&quot;, but &quot;Nights On Broadway&quot; is, once again, cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work.<p>This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning.  &quot;One Night Only&quot; is a great live recording as well, but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation.
 B004BH1TN0, A1R6DF0KOJ0TG6, Rona, 2/2, 5.0, 1043712000, Bee Gees - Live by Request, This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous!  It was even fun listening to the request call-ins.  Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live.  Love those guys!! Also, they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts.  I highly recommend this DVD!
 B004BH1TN0, A9Q28YTLYREO7, A customer "mistermaxxx", 2/2, 4.0, 1033776000, Good Set, of course it's really good to hear all the Bee Gees Jams on a Album but live is even better.the only down side is the fact that some of the songs are done in Medley form&that kinda leaves it just there overall to me.but all in all this is a real good show&performance.
 B004BH1TN0, AVV8PPI6BDKVA, "utawwsexy", 2/2, 5.0, 1030233600, THE BEE GEES RULE!!, I own this DVD, along with their "One Night Only" DVD, & I have to tell you--I love 'em both!! They sound just as good (or better) as when they were younger--I play one after the other at times (there are a few new songs on "This Is Where I Came In") on my stereo, set for DTS--ohhhh the sound is INCREDIBLE!!  I catch myself "boogie-ing"(not sure how to spell that--sorry) constantly...I'm 31 years old & LOVE the Bee Gees!!  What more can I say? :)

As African Americans our (my family) taste in music is culturally diverse and the Bee Gees are on the top of our lists.  This concert is a definite must see ranking right up there with their "One Night Only" concert.  Several songs on this DVD I've never heard before but they have become my favorites. The Bee Gees were very playful/silly/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group.

Chung "music lover", 0/0, 4.0, 1168819200, bee gees fans enjoy, This is a fine performance by the Bee Gees who perform "by request", probably the most difficult format for live performers.  They play most of their songs and most fans might complain about various hits that were omitted.  Still an enjoyable performance.
 B004BH1TN0, AUQW6UEZFC7B2, Country Woman, 0/0, 5.0, 1051228800, Wonderful!, I have been a Bee Gees fan for years.  It is really wonderful to see them again.  I love the songs from the new album &quot;This is Where I In&quot;.  It is really great to hear Maurice take the lead in two of the songs, &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air&quot;.  While Barry and Robin have beautiful voices, I really enjoy listening to Maurice sing. After all these years, it is really great to see and hear the joy they still get from their music and from preforming together.<br />While precious minutes of the show were taken up with requests, it was still nice to see their interaction with the fans.  I think anyone who is a fan of Barry, Robin and Maurice will enjoy this video.  I have watched it over and over.  It is really sad that we won't have the chance to see the three of them together like this again.

Since the movie was done in two parts, the second one repeats a lot as if one was not there to view the first part.  I did not like that at all.  The point to this movie is really good.  I'm actually going to send it to someone that has held "life" against God.  This is an excellent ministering tool!!
 B0071AD95K, A13NO1WIGJZUV4, J. A. Handford, 4/4, 5.0, 1295136000, Finding Hope in the face of loss, This DVD was very helpful for those who had lost a loved one in our family of faith. It was able to show that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones are gone from here --- they are still with us in spirit. It made our faith stronger and brought our family closer together in God's love. Louie Giglio is a Christian who's spirit sends a loving message from his heart.
 B0071AD95K, AOIT2QUH8GRGA, Ryan's mom, 3/3, 5.0, 1288569600, Very inspiring!  Great for teenagers and young adults., The whole Passion Series is life changing, a must have for any Christian household that has teenagers and young adults.  Louie has wonderful approach to teaching about the magnificence of God, the Creater of Heaven and Earth!  My  16 year old niece was so impressed and awe-struck after viewing "How Great is Our God" and "Indescribable" that she ended up taking the whole series home with her to share with all her friends.  Needless to say, I let her keep them and purchased a new series for myself. I am going to be showing my Bible study group "How Great is Our God" tonight as we have a skeptic in our group.  I know this video will dispel any doubts she may have about God!  The "Hope" video is equally inspiring in a different way, more focused on real life rather than creation.  It is a compliment to the "Fruitcake and Ice Cream" video which deals with a real life story of a young college student who comes to know Christ.
 B0071AD95K, A2D595HNMO9PHR, Stephen, 1/1, 5.0, 1287187200, Exceptional, This is an amazing video for those who are suffering. When life hurts most, when the bottom falls out, when tragedy strikes I need to know, "Is there still hope for me?" Louie answers a resounding YES. He explores the topic of suffering better than anyone I've heard. I was deeply inspired by this two-part video series. I recommend you buy it if you're hurting.
 B0071AD95K, A3ENN12GLNTUAF, J. Kennel "marriagefanatic", 1/1, 5.0, 1274745600, Terrific DVD for anyone suffering, This DVD is the third in the Passion 2006 series done by Louie Giglio.  The four videos go in order, so it is helpful to see them in order to follow the story throughout all of them.  However, having said that, this is still a very moving presentation about pain, suffering, and hope.  I would recommend this for high school and older, for Christians and non-Christians.<br /><br />You can watch this with someone who is suffering, and no one has to say a word at the end.  It is not intrusive or offensive, but is comforting because it is about the God who is truly big enough to comfort anyone in the worst circumstances in life.  And everyone experiences them at some point.  With this Hope presentation, and with all of them in the series, you definitely will sense that God does the supernatural "heavy lifting" that no human possibly can.<br /><br />Excellent for mentoring teens and older.  The audience in the video is largely college age.  Highly recommended!
 B0071AD95K, A2OKCS5234ZV7S, Flower, 4/6, 5.0, 1267401600, Wow............., This is an awesome addition to your movie collection!... A great tool to use to witness to others. All four are great and I think that you need all four. We own all four and even our children are interested in the series. They even repeat things that are stated in the serious. We are all amazed at the topics and images. You will have to see this for yourself. If you have viewed any of the others, Hope is a must view as well. There really are not any words to describe the experience of viewing Hope. Also there is no statement that can tell you the experience of owning all four to share with others. You never know when you may encounter someone who may need what is in this series and you to can use this series to win souls, and bring someone out of the darkness and into the light.<br /><br />Our souls have truly been blessed by this series... we plan to bless others when they visit us with this series. Go ahead and Bless yourself, family, and friends with this awesome series, make sure you get all four and view them all. We tried to view them in the order that they are listed inside of the dvd. I don't know if it matters, as it is just what we did. Now we are waiting on the Blind side to come out.. Enjoy! You won't be the same! A treat for the whole family, friends, church family, and the neighborhood! Don't forget the popcorn! We use the crazy popcorn popper it is awesome with movies or without!<br /><br />This is one series that we are glad we did not pass by... all cultures will and should enjoy this!<br /><br />Always watch what you do and say to others as you never know what they are going through, or the impact you will have on them, and you never know who you are entertaining.<br /><br />Keep up the Good Work Louie Giglio!

Louis is a great communicator who uses stories about real people and the Word of God to point out our only hope when difficulties in life arise, and they will.  It is a great resource for encouragement when life's hurts hit.  I recommend it to anyone, believer in Christ or not.

 B0071AD95K, A2BTR8ZO8MB01D, Eric Lessner "Eric0118", 0/0, 5.0, 1276387200, Extremely Inspisrational, Louie has some of the most inspirational an thought provoking sermons I have ever heard. He is truly anointed!
 B000063W1R, A29DLKCN8QWO7B, Terrie "seamstress", 1/1, 5.0, 1348012800, One of my favorites!, This is one of my all-time favorite movies for escaping from worldly work.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce have great chemistry and the trials of Edmond Dantes are laid out (although too brief for me) in historically correct detail.<br />Even though this movie loosely follows Dumas' book, the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits.
 B000063W1R, A295JWKTJLM7YT, LBurkett, 1/1, 5.0, 1348012800, GREAT movie, LOVE this movie - loved it when it first came out and still love it - awesome shots and wonderful story line....Jim C is an AMAZING actor!
 B000063W1R, A1M3W0ROKC7F3C, Brandy51 "Brandy", 1/1, 5.0, 1347840000, I love a well rounded movie, don't you?, This movie has everything I like: a great story and plot with suspense, lots of action, some comedy, romance and great effects. No question - I had to buy it.
 B000063W1R, A2M2O1DI1SCQDI, Mimi, 1/1, 5.0, 1344816000, The Count of Monte Cristo (Blu-ray), Great Blu-ray DVD for the price!  The graphic and sound quality is excellent.  The product was received less than 7 days and was well packaged.
 B000063W1R, A2IOMS4TK2QSFW, Holly N., 1/1, 4.0, 1331769600, Revenge, served by Jim Cavizel, I love this movie! Sure, the acting isn't oscar worthy, but the characters are interesting in this classic story. It also helps that Jim Caviezel is smoking HOT in this remake of Dumas' famous story.
 B000063W1R, A2YWH9COGWT8VU, ECastle, 1/1, 5.0, 1331510400, Better than the book, I love to read and am normally disappointed in the movies which are based on those books. This is the exception. Great, believable characters. Excellent character development. And some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested.
 B000063W1R, A3QIEISBZP4QTV, Mark E. Baxter "Inquirer", 1/1, 5.0, 1320278400, One of the best adventure movies ever, Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on, use a great director, pick great locations, assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors, and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay, and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be.  Adventure, mystery, romance, action sequences, character and plot development, and humor are all combined into a masterpiece.<br /><br />The 1,000 page book by Dumas is, of course, a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like.  The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways.  Incredibly, the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending.  I can't say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel.  The screenplay is perfectly balanced.  If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark, the action so blurred, the characters so poorly developed, and the plot so weak that you aren't even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen, you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand.<br /><br />The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn.  Caviezel just couldn't be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life.  Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune, played by the late Richard Harris, and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him.<br /><br />Without giving any more of the plot away, let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has.<br /><br />Available in several formats, and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years, I definitely recommend this movie highly.  Five stars.
 B000063W1R, A17RUD7RKGZUA4, PINKPEARL, 1/1, 5.0, 1300147200, AWESOME, I have to say I was so impressed with this movie.  It is a great movie, and though not a Christian movie, it has a lot of God themes mingled in between.  I highly recommend this movie.  I am buying 2 other to give away.  SEE it, you will not be disappointed.
 B000063W1R, A18758S1PUYIDT, Viva, 1/1, 4.0, 1288051200, A tale of revenge, love, adventure, and endurance, I should have read the book by now!  That's what I was thinking as I was halfway through this particular version--the only movie version I've seen so far.  The cast is okay, though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating.  The hellhole of the prison was portrayed effectively, and I totally understand Dantes' (sp?) desire for revenge, although he does learn eventually that living just to get even is not the ideal way to live after all.
 B000063W1R, A2UFG3DMVELP6I, Arturo Bustamante "Art", 1/1, 5.0, 1275264000, Good, The movie was great I like it I actually ordered as a gift I already own it.  The price was good and so was the delivery.  Happy with the order.
 B000063W1R, A4FBBS25X3XEL, M. Pruitt, 1/1, 5.0, 1249344000, An all around great movie!, The Count Of Monte Cristo is an all around great movie. You have an excellent story line and plot. You get action, suspense, romance and even a couple of laughs. All this in a movie without nudity, sex or bad language. There is violence, but not in the excessive, graphic way we have come to expect from Hollywood. This movie is proof positive that you don't have to have explicit sex, language or blood and guts to have a great movie! I highly recommend it.
 B000063W1R, A23Q1T4MXZHFM7, susumu-5, 1/1, 3.0, 1244937600, Monte Cristo in 2 Hour Film?, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an over-1200-page voluminous novel. How could this super-long drama be fit into two hours? This film did that misson-impossible task. Compared with French TV-series starring Gerald Depardieu as the Count of Monte Cristo, first half of the story is well depicted, while the latter part is too brief. There is no Valentine nearly poisoned by her step mother, no Haydee, former Turk princess. And the story depends too much on duels so it is more visually described than the original story's deliberate revenge plan. But the relief is that Albert's role is spared and is given a huge part in this drama.<br /><br />Verdict: Monte Cristo for Young Adults<br />Rating: 70 out of 100. For shorter adaptation it is good.<br />Recommended for: Historical action movie fans and Three Musketeers appreciators.
 B000063W1R, ANZNLFBN62YKH, James D'arcy Pacita D'arcy, 1/1, 5.0, 1237334400, The best version of the Count of Monte Cristo I have seen, Richard Harris and Guy  Pearce made this movie great. All of the actors were superb and I think that the actual Chateau D'If was used. Superb in every way except not long enough.
 B000063W1R, A2FX6OHBMQ9545, S. AIKEN, 1/1, 4.0, 1236729600, better than previous adapations, The Count of Monte Cristo is a promising film, not as good as the original novel, but if it promises to get some interested in reading the book by Dumas, than it is worth watching.<br /><br />Richard Harris is always a pleasure to watch when he plays of character of Education or Tutoring.
 B000063W1R, A1MIFONBFK8OWE, Casey Scott, 1/1, 4.0, 1236038400, Great rainy day movie, Sit back and enjoy the interesting and exciting story of the Count Of Monte Cristo. Great rainy day movie!
 B000063W1R, A1DZ4MTJY8LAVG, Ken Gingerly, 1/1, 4.0, 1235606400, The Count of Monte Cristo, Great movie.  Saw it once and had to have it.  Mail delivery was prompt.
 B000063W1R, A3NNR95R50VB4W, J. Smith, 1/1, 5.0, 1235001600, My Favorite Movie, I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this movie in theaters, but I loved the whole movie.<br /><br />The action, plot, suspense...wonderfully wrapped into this movie.  I enjoyed the movie so much that I have started to read the book.  A classic book and great movie. Revenge is so well portrayed in this movie.  Vengence, honor, love, justice.  So good!<br /><br />This is my favorite movie to date!
 B000063W1R, A19O5ETNRJN39D, D. Myers, 1/1, 5.0, 1232064000, spell-binding, I am not a movie fan.  I find it difficult to sit and watch a story for 2 hours (and nearly impossible to 'suspend disbelief').  I will not pretend to write a clinical analysis of movie-making.  I will simply say I have seen this movie twice (and plan to see it again, nearly unheard of in my case) and both times was fully enveloped in this fascinating, beautifully told story.  That editing and departure from the novel occurred in some points is no surprise (just 2 hours), but the essence of the story remains, the victory of good over evil.  Tremendous movie.
 B000063W1R, AMEJTGF5NQLNH, M. Miller, 1/1, 3.0, 1227916800, The Passion of Monte Cristo, We must allow James Caviezel to be very good at being lashed- I believe, in fact, it was that aspect of this very performance that landed him the role of Jesus in Passion of the Christ. Besides that, he makes a pretty face, along with Guy Pearce, although somehow Pearce seems ESPECIALLY short in this film. Anyways, the acting is so-so, Caviezel plays Dantes as a whiny little brat, Guy Pearce acts like an evil gremlin, and the end ends happily as hollywood must, tho it makes the story more lame. The one reason to watch: Michael Wincott is excellent and deliciously evil as the prison warden for the Chateau D'if
 B000063W1R, A1DDVFGUC6NQD3, M. Gibson, 1/1, 5.0, 1221264000, This movie had a story, So much better than any movie I have seen lately.  I had never read the book or seen the movie and I just loved it.  It captured my imagination and the acting was so believable.  Jim C. was the Count.  I want to see it again and again.
 B000063W1R, A36SSF310LBGSE, freedom78, 1/1, 3.0, 1205020800, Good...but lacking., I hate to give this film three stars. Or, rather, I hate that a film based on the book of the same title is worthy of only three stars. In most cases, I do my best to separate my opinions about a piece of literature, on one hand, and a film based on that literature, on the other. And there's no question that this film adequately and entertainingly captures the tale of revenge. What it lacks is the intricacy of Dumas's work, which really captures the meticulous planning and plotting that go into the protagonist's desire for vengeance. I cannot fault the film too much, as the level of detail required might have made this 2 hr. film much, much longer, which can be a fault, unto itself. I do recommend this movie, and for those who find it compelling, I give a far greater recommendation to the book.
 B000063W1R, A63FDY7VFOMQV, J. Thomas, 1/1, 5.0, 1198972800, Love this movie but hard to find in stores, This is a wonderful movie. I bought this for my Mom she just loves it! The process was extreamly fast and hastle free at Amazon.
 B000063W1R, A3R95JCH1K9R0S, Randall Shute "The Coroner of China", 1/1, 5.0, 1198627200, Make sure they're sitting down when you tell them...., This is a well done movie of my favourite story to date.  There's some time spent in France and then it's around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now.  Although the book of the same title by Alexander Dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one.  This is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and I think personally this version is the first one you should see.  Boy has girl, boy has a friend, boy has his dreams come true... boy doing there... who me Tarzan?<br /><br />While this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in it's production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from Hollywood and even to this day.<br /><br />Splendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thing.<br />The sets are over the top.  There are some mansions and country-estates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms.
 B000063W1R, A2IT3899H776LW, AVA VAN "Caveziel fan", 1/1, 5.0, 1198540800, In my top 10 great movies, ACTION,ADVENTURE, INTRIGE, ROMANCE this movie has it all.This is<br />Jim's finest film...he was better in this than the PASSION OF THE CHRIST.<br />I have never read the book, but, I probably will now.  There is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists. I am amazed that the casting Director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly.  In addition, the young man that played Jim's son must be his brother, cousin,etc in real life because he looks just like him.<br />The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying.
 B000063W1R, A3NWP0SFAC0ZD2, K. Wells, 1/1, 5.0, 1196121600, Superb Acting and Action!, A very well-done film and an excellent cast.  I'd put it right up with the Three and Four Musketeers movies (York, Reed, Chamberlain, Heston, etc).
 B000063W1R, A1AFHYBINSG7PH, K. Atkins, 1/1, 4.0, 1193443200, The Count of Monte Cristo, This is an excellent movie and I never read the book.  The acting and the plot was very nice done, it is one of my favorite movies.
 B000063W1R, A3N2MVBI1A2I9Y, Jerry, 1/1, 5.0, 1192924800, wow, It is one of the best films I have seen and seen and seen. I can't tell you how many times I have watched this movie and still enjoy watching it again. The acting is surperb and the quality of the story is deep, entertaining, and thought provoking. An awesome buy and the purpose of owning is to watch it and watch it again and again if not why not just rent.
 B000063W1R, A3VP6XR88INLRB, M. J. McManus, 1/1, 4.0, 1189641600, Great "sleeper" movie, This is a great movie.  That many people don't know about.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce do great acting.  I think after Guy Pearce's performance, I won't like him if I ever meet him in real life.  He makes his character so dis likable.  Which is the point!
 B000063W1R, A355WMP0CQBJFX, horrorqueen, 1/1, 5.0, 1189641600, A MOVIE THAT MEETS THE STANDARDS OF THE BOOK!!, this movie is incredible. very captivating from beginning to end. sensational movie, very well done, and played out. truly stands up to the book, which was beautifully written. a bit of difference, but came out well enough to be a success. the count of monte cristo has so much in it. a young man, innocent, trusting, and in love losses it all in a second because of his suppose friends jelousy. all is taken and all hope seems lost, until he meets a friend, meanwhile his anger and vengance grow. he returns to a whole different world. his only thought is revenge, but so many twists and turns he doesn't even expect what happens to happen. this has innocence, betrayel, cruelty, hardship, vengance, love, and friendship all in one. beautiful story, a hard era, and excellent film. the actors were superb. jim caviezel, a wonderful actor. there's just something about him that makes him very interesting to watch. those eyes just draw you in and his talent, makes him great. he was spectacular in this film. guy pearce, shined his on his own behalf. did it so well that you actually hated him in this movie. all of the actors were great, made it so dramatic, it was believable. nicely done.
 B000063W1R, A2CU4L3OK00M23, C. Reich, 1/1, 5.0, 1189036800, A classic movie, There is nothing bad to say about this movie.  The story, the acting, everything is well done.  I bought it to watch over and over.
 B000063W1R, A41I67QYRAOSQ, Fish Hunter "Eddie", 1/1, 4.0, 1188172800, Innocence turned to Revenge!, Very good acting!  A bad guy you love to hate.  Very romantic.  Feel good story.  Action.  A little adventure and definitive intriguge!  It all makes for an excellent story you will enjoy.
 B000063W1R, A1XY417YALQB6G, CMR, 1/1, 5.0, 1187913600, Excellent!!!, This is a movie that should be included in everyones cinema collection!  The scenes and fantastic cast taps into every emotion.  I was at the edge of my seat for more than one scene!  I will enjoy watching this movie for years to come.
 B000063W1R, A2PNB2HQTF51UE, Cherie M. Faiola "sprintschic", 1/1, 5.0, 1182816000, The Count of Monte Cristo, This is one of the best films I have seen. It's in great shape, I don't remember, but it may have been new. It works perfectly, and I am so lucky to own it.
 B000063W1R, ATQDMCZ904Y4W, Anna B., 1/1, 5.0, 1016755200, An unexpected treat, The Count of Monte Cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years. I was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try. However, both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find a well-directed movie with superior acting by James Caviezel. He's done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous, yet calculated revenge. I also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the "bigger" names. Save your time and money -skip Moulin Rouge and see this great movie! In my opinion, it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far.
 B000063W1R, A1IJINKEDO8E8A, M. Enfield "PT", 3/4, 5.0, 1134604800, excellent movie!!  you won't pause it for anything!, The first time I watched this movie, my cousin brought it over to my house on a movie night.  when she said what she was bringing to watch, i said "what? the count of who?"  never heard of it and immediately assumed that it would be not worth my time.<br /><br />I was mistaken.  I could not take my eyes off of the movie and spent the next 2 hours enthralled.<br /><br />if you are wondering whether this is worth the money.....spend it, you'll definately be happy you did.
 B000063W1R, AQ8DU6XVA3USJ, Alejandra Vernon "artist & illustrator", 3/4, 5.0, 1085011200, &quot;you must look into that storm&quot;, Based on the Dumas story, this fabulous adventure about a naive, illiterate young man in 19th century France whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance, is well written with wit and intelligence, and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute film.<br />The location cinematography in Malta and Ireland is spectacular, though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murky.<br />The soundtrack by Edward Shearmur is also top-notch, and adds a lot to the film.<p>The cast:<br />Jim Caviezel brilliantly captures the essence of the Dantes/Count character; believable both as the innocent Edmund and the worldly Count of Monte Cristo, with his swashbuckling prowess and elegant style.<br />Richard Harris as the priest who mentor Dantes is marvelous; wily and wise, it's a perfect part for Harris, and he makes the most of it.<br />Other standout performances come from Guy Peerce as Fernand, Michael Wincott as Armand Dorelac, the Warden of d'If, and most of all, Luis Guzman as a very funny Jacopo.<p>This is terrific family viewing, free of the plague of foul language and heavy breathing between the sheets that have made films so tiresome in recent years. This film will feed your brain, delight your eyes, and raise your heartbeat a little with its fast-paced exploits about &quot;kings and pawns, emperors and fools&quot;.
 B000063W1R, A1ICAVFAYAJDUP, "princesssilvia", 5/7, 5.0, 1037491200, Fabulous Entertainment!, This is, by far, the best rendition for the big screen of the novel by Dumas (although it's not 100% close to the book) and, by far, one of the best movies in recent years.<br />What other movie do you remember going to, where, at the end, while the titles scroll, a roar of applause comes from the audience? I've lended my DVD to a few skeptic friends and all not only liked the movie, they LOVED IT!<br />Wonderfully acted, with wonderful scenery, this movie truly deserves more credit that it has gotten. STARS hands down!
 B000063W1R, ALX2RTJW3NF0O, D. McGrath "dmack58", 2/3, 4.0, 1204675200, Torment and vengeance, If you like movies like Braveheart, The Patriot, and Gladiator, then you will enjoy The Count of Monte Cristo.<br />Rating: Buy
 B000063W1R, A1KPXFWEB2TLGR, Julian J. Robinson, 2/3, 5.0, 1204588800, Excellent, the perfect movie<br />great plot<br />exceptional ending<br />must see movie
 B000063W1R, A2M6FIWDCDWDVM, Lisa Higgins "bearloverb4u", 2/3, 5.0, 1163376000, Excellent, Do you remember having to read this story in high school literature? I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now.  The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination.  It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance, intrigue, sword fights, action. Definitely a movie to add to your collection.
 B000063W1R, A3QEBUBAQHE4DI, blacketarani, 2/3, 4.0, 1144800000, Excellent - if you don't want to watch Count of Monte Cristo., Yes, it is called Count of Monte Cristo, but let's just say that the story bears little resemblance to the literature. Yes, Edmond Dantes is wrongly imprisoned and meets someone there that helps him get out and rain misfortunes down on those who were responsible for his time in the Chateau d'If. That's pretty much where the similarities end. The methods of revenge in the movie are much less imaginative, basically consisting of him telling them he is Dantes and then killing them. These replace Dumas' genius methods - economic ruin, mental insanity, suicide, etc.<br /><br />However, if you don't want to commit to reading a 1500 page book, and can't devise a way to see the play adaptation, you will never know the differences, and this is a good movie. Just take it on it's own merits rather than on the book's.
 B000063W1R, A3AE7GKA6NF3ML, Tricecakes "La Trice", 2/3, 5.0, 1119312000, Our Family Rates This As One Of Our Favorite Movies!!!, This is one of our favorite movies.  We seldom like to see a movie more than twice.  However, this movie was so entertaining (as well as it contained excellent drama, acting, and a well developed plot), that we have viewed it numerous times.  My Teenage kids as well as my younger boys enjoyed the movie.  I did have to re-explain some moral issues & contradictions concerning the implied premarital sex and adultery.  We used the theme of revenge vs forgiveness as a discussion tool. It was also refreshing to see a movie with positive references to God and still be exciting.  We are going to read the book this summer, and We don't expect the book and the movie to be exactly the same.  They are two different expressions.
 B000063W1R, A1FBZRYTAA6O1Z, Andrew Urquhart "Metal Guru", 2/3, 5.0, 1105920000, Amazing film - but with a couple of minor glitches, I'll admit, I've not read the original source novel on which this is based (the only thing by Dumas I have read, is the classic 'Musketeers'); life is too short to read every great novel, try as one might - but having seen this film, I am determined to seek out the text.<br /><br /> Judging the film on its own terms, I found this immensely satisfying, and though quite long (131 min), it does not drag for a second. The story itself is really quite something, and no matter how many films you have seen, or books you have read, you will be absolutely bowled over (as George Bernard Shaw was) by the breadth, depth, simplicity and universality of it.<br /><br /> There are some minor faults with the film; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted (eg. Guy Pearce, an Australian who has mastered a range of accents, seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain: Daniel Day-Lewis did a much better job in 'Gangs of New York'). There is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion, no matter how memorable it may be - but even compared with 'Barry Lyndon' (Kubrick), this is still a riveting, assured adaptation.<br /><br /> These are very minor quibbles, and I would put this in with some of my favourite films, along with 'Captain Blood' (Errol Flynn), 'Koyanisquaatsi', 'New Cinema Paradiso' and 'Celebration' (aka Festen). Generally, the script is absolutely top notch, full of little throw-away quips and putdowns. The cast is absolutely stunning, especially James Calaziel, absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to cold-blooded avenger. Watch out for Luis Guizman as a scheming pirate.<br /><br /> Very highly recommended, for those who seek something a little more high-brow than the standard multiplex schlock.
 B000063W1R, A2FEGRJQNU51P9, Joe Sherry, 2/3, 4.0, 1082592000, a nice adaptation of Dumas's clasic novel, A film by Kevin Reynolds<p>This is the recent film adaptation of Dumas's classic novel "The Count of Monte Cristo".  From the previews and early reviews of the movie I did not expect too much from it, but when someone whose opinion I trust tells me that it is good and that I should watch it, I was willing to give it a chance.  Good thing, because this is a pretty good movie.  <p>The story, if you are not familiar with the source material, follows Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel).  Dantes, in the film, is a sailor and the film opens with Dantes and his friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pierce) trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying.  The island just happens to be the prison island where Napoleon is exiled, and while they get help, Napoleon asks Dantes if he could take a personal, and innocent, letter to a friend.  Dantes agrees.  Dantes returns to France and does not have a chance to deliver the letter, though we do see his fianc&eacute; Mercedes Iguanada (Dagmara Dominczyk) and a little bit of Mondego's jealousy.  Dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason.  That innocent letter that Dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all.  The magistrate has Dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years.  <p>This is where the movie truly begins.  Dantes was innocent and he was betrayed (we soon learn that Mondego is now married to Mercedes), and he wants his revenge, though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison.  While in prison, Dantes meets Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), a man who is digging a tunnel (slowly, inch by inch) to escape.  Faria trains Dantes in the sword, teaches him how to read, science, literature, politics, and how to be a noble.  He also tells Dantes of a treasure, the treasure of Monte Cristo, that may or may not exist.  <p>We wouldn't have a story if Dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge, so I'm not spoiling anything by revealing that.  Dantes sets himself up as the Count of Monte Cristo with the help of a man named Jacopo (Luis Guzman).  Dantes is now free to pursue his revenge.  <p>The story feels like it has been simplified a little bit, but this film is good enough, and slick enough, and entertaining enough, that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  No film can ever capture the nuance of a novel, especially not a 1000 page novel.  With the amount of time allotted this film, "The Count of Monte Cristo" succeeds at being an entertaining film.
 B000063W1R, A18XYPKYS15YBP, Lisa "southernbelle54", 2/3, 3.0, 1055116800, Great...until the ending, I read the 'Monte Cristo' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it, so I was really pumped up to see it on screen. First off, the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film. BUT,I have to take points off for the ending. Whenever a book is made into a movie, the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually. My issue was not just that the ending was changed, it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book! It was totally ridiculous! It was exactly what you would expect to happen, even though it was totally unrealistic. That's why I gave it only three stars. If you're speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience, it's a wonderful film. I suggest that you read the book first, see the movie, and judge for yourself. Or if you've already seen the film, go read the book anyway and see what you missed.
 B000063W1R, A1EMDSTJDUE6B0, Randy Given, 2/3, 5.0, 1042761600, Great Job, Most of the older style movies really turn me off, but not this one. I really enjoyed it. Too many of the &quot;old&quot; ones try too hard to be dramatic -- kinda like high school actors who have to talk too loud and be too flamboyant. This movie was a pleasant surprise. The actors are really good.<p>The plot is good and keeps you in your seat. Some of the things are a little predictable, but it is hard not to want to make sure that your hopes come true. You can feel yourself cringe and want to shout &quot;don't do this&quot; or &quot;don't do that&quot; or &quot;get'em&quot;.<p>The cinematography is very good and appropriate. There are not some of the anachronisms of many other film interpretations.<p>If you watch one &quot;old style&quot; movie per year, this one should be the one you watch this year.
 B000063W1R, A7FMCZZVFHRLW, Jason A. Myers "jaypers", 2/3, 4.0, 1035158400, Wow, a really great re-doing of the story, I very much enjoyed this iteration of the Count. It was well filmed and well acted. It makes a person think of what they would do if they suddenly got very rich and had blood enemies. Would you seek revenge or would you be fat and rich?<br />Guy Peirce gives a wonderful performance.<br />Rent this movie you will like it and probably want to purchase it.
 B000063W1R, A861XPXU3SH9M, Brad, 2/3, 5.0, 1025654400, Amazing!, This movie was truly amazing! Jim Caviezel was excellent as the count, and you loved to hate Guy Pearce as his friend-gone-enemy.<br />The cenimatography was beautiful, and while it was long, you love every minute of it. There are some well done action sequences (with quickened framework that adds to the tension) and the adaptation from the novel (while forced to leave a lot out, obviously...the book is insanely long!)is far better than most works of this sort. It maintains a more comic-book approach to violence and gore (the same as Mask Of Zorro, in that they leave a lot of blood and guts out, so if you're looking for shredded bodies go elsewhere) and it's well worth your while!

I read the "cheater" comic. This picture, although a little off the original storyline is one of the best remakes I have seen. The cast is marvelous and the twists and turns are presented well. The picture falters slightly toward the end but it is a minimal fault. Overall, the DVD is eminently watchable and good fun. The quality is excellent. Amazon seems to consistently present good, quality DVD's at good quality prices. The disc came on time and I was happy to add it to my library.

 B000063W1R, A2DPL3M7VU1GYZ, Mark Twain, 0/0, 5.0, 1347148800, The Count of Monte Cristo, I rented this movie to have a small idea of what it was about because I was monitoring the homework of a 9th. grader tasked with reading the book and answering questions.  It seems to have followed the book fairly closely.  At least I could ask relative questions.  It was well worth the rental fee.

 B000063W1R, A2198FZZMTJ38H, D. Litton, 253/269, 5.0, 1012608000, Count on revenge, and then some., After attending the release of "The Count of Monte Cristo," a friend made the remark that he believed the movie could benefit from additional fight sequences. Immediately my mind shot back to last year's "The Musketeer," also based (rather loosely, I might add) on another of Alexandre Dumas' famous classics. In that film, character development, story, and tone were sacrificed for the sake of creating yet another movie in which a choreographer of Chinese descent was allowed to make an impression on action aficionados by dazzling them with techniques reminiscent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." <p>What a relief that this latest adaptation of a Dumas novel strays from the usual clich&eacute;s and redundancy of bringing a classic work of literature to the screen, coming out as a sturdy, well-guided costume drama that combines action, intensity, passion, and most importantly, revenge. With a script that keeps much of the novel's intricacies intact, a cast befitting of their roles, and a director who keeps things interesting at all times, this is one swashbuckling adventure that pleases in all fields. <p>The story centers around Edmund Dantes (Jim Caviezel), a sailor from a middle class upbringing in the town of Marseilles. He has a friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), whose father is a wealthy aristocrat; despite his rich lifestyle, Mondego still harbors a slight jealousy for Dantes, who has just been promoted to captain of his vessel, allowing him the opportunity to marry his longtime love, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Overcome by envy, Mondego concocts a vicious plan with the equally jealous first mate of Dantes' boat that lands a wrongfully accused Dantes in the Chateau d'If for more than a decade.<p>During his years of imprisonment, Dantes' resolve is strengthened by brutal beatings, and by his friendship with fellow prisoner Faria (Richard Harris), who teaches Dantes to read and write, the articulate moves of swordplay, and offers him the location of a long-lost treasure that would give him the means to exact his revenge on those who have wronged him. Faria's death provides Dantes the method of escape he needs, and once out, he begins his quest. <p>The second half of the movie takes the movie to new heights of interest, as Dantes makes his big entrance in Paris as the Count of Monte Cristo, bent on exacting his revenge on Mondego, now married to a repressed, sullen Mercedes, and on Villefort, the police chief who played a role in his wrongful incarceration. Anyone familiar with revenge plots is well aware that this is a dish best served cold, and many will delight in the cooly calculated revelations and confrontations that arise as Dantes's master plan begins to unfold. <p>Accompanying this feeling of satisfaction is the movie's wondrous appearance and execution. The look and feel of the film drips with the quality of the swashbuckling adventures of yesteryear, with its themes of vengeance and nobility, it's glorious costumes and set design, and a final showdown that provides a slam-bang finish complete with suspense and fist-clenching thrills. Reynolds, and screenwriter Jay Wolpert, have realized the novel for the screen in a manner that is pleasing to the eye and the mind, keeping in touch with everything that has immortalized Dumas' work without reworking key moments to make room for modern artistic influences.<p>If this weren't enough to please popcorn audiences and literary buffs, the cast is completely remarkable. Jim Caviezel plays Dantes with the conviction of a man wrongfully accused; by the time he escapes prison, we are all for him and his brilliantly conceived plan. His chemistry with leading lady Dagmara Dominczyk is a welcome slice of old-fashioned romance, while his scenes with Guy Pearce provide a nice contrast of nobility and jealousy, which Pearce perfects in his performance as Mondego. Also worthy of noting are the appearances of Richard Harris and Lius Guzman, who provide humorous touches throughout. <p>More than anything else, this latest big-screen version of "The Count of Monte Cristo" is a wonderful popcorn adventure replete with everything you could possibly ask for in a film of this sort. Overall, it remains faithful enough to its source, and keeps us enlightened and entertained throughout its well-acted, well-directed, well-executed duration. Count on revenge, and then some.
 B000063W1R, A328S9RN3U5M68, Grady Harp, 104/110, 5.0, 1031875200, A surprisingly fresh and superb adventure film, In this time of fire and explosion oriented blockbuster movies it is indeed refreshing to find a remake of a classic novel of the quality of The Count of Monte Cristo currently available.  I happened to nonchalantly choose this film at the DVD outlet as a source of viewing background for an evening of desk work.  WRONG!  This superbly made film of the Dumas' novel is excellent and gripping on every level.  The quality of the film, shot in Ireland and Malta, is visually stunning, the story remains true to the original, and the cast is outstanding.  James Caviezel makes a star turn in the title role, aided by the always excellent Guy Pearce, the veteran Richard Harris, the here venomous James Frain, a fine and very different role for Luis Guzman, and the elegantly beautiful Dagmara Domincyzk.  The movie is beautifully paced, the long prison scenes allow Caviezel and Harris to create tremendous rapport, and the age old theme of REVENGE has rarely been played out so well.  This is a beautiful period piece, finely photographed and scored and edited and directed.  For a taste of just how exciting the old tales can be visually, treat yourself to an evening with The Count!
 B000063W1R, A2V3P1XE33NYC3, Jeffrey Leach, 85/89, 4.0, 1054857600, Not the Story, but Enjoyable Nontheless, If you have never discovered the wonderful world of Alexandre Dumas, I urge you to run, not walk to the local library or bookstore and obtain a copy of "Le Comte de Monte Christo." I also recommend reading the unabridged version of this classic tale about a man who takes revenge on his enemies. One thing is certain: do not attempt to take the lazy way out by watching this adaptation of Dumas's novel. Two hours will never be enough time to adequately express the majestic beauty of this novel written by a phenomenal storyteller. Having said that, I enjoyed immensely this version of the story starring Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, and Richard Harris. Period pieces are often fun to watch, and this one is no exception. With a few problematic exceptions, "The Count of Monte Christo" is an entertaining film.<p>The tale, if you are not familiar with it, focuses on a French sailor named Edmond Dantes. On a trading trip back to Marseilles, Dantes had the misfortune to stop at the island of Elba, the home of the exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. With his captain dead, Dantes arrives in port and is promptly promoted to become the new captain. This step up in status angers several people around Dantes, specifically Danglars, Villefort, and Mondego. The three conspire to have Edmond arrested on charges of treason and thrown into a political prison called the Chateau D'If. Dantes spends years suffering in solitary confinement, although he eventually meets an elderly prisoner named Faria who educates him while they plan their escape. Moreover, this prisoner tells Edmond about a fabulous treasure that could be his for the taking. Eventually, Dantes escapes and embarks on a series of adventures that finds him returning to seek revenge against his enemies under the name "Le Comte de Monte Christo."<p>This very short description of Dumas's novel obviously leaves out much of the plot. It also highlights the inherent difficulties in translating "The Count of Monte Christo" into a two-hour film. There is just too much detail, characters, and sub-plots in the novel to work with. The revenge plots Dantes formulates against his enemies alone are of such length and complexity that it would take hours to encapsulate them on the silver screen. Throw in the sub-plot of the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa (who does appear in the film), which is of immense importance in the novel, and it is impossible to adequately convey the full majesty of this classic on celluloid. Fortunately, this film manages to entertain while retaining key elements of the written story.<p>The first part of the movie hews closely to the novel with a few notable exceptions. The film begins with Edmond and his friend Mondego landing on Elba, where they have a shoot out with British security forces before personally meeting the deposed emperor. Back in Marseilles, we meet Mercedes, Dantes girlfriend and a character who plays a big role in the written story. The filmmakers do insert a warden for Chateau D'If, played by actor Michael Wincott, who does not appear in the book. If you are familiar with Wincott, you will remember his voice and his presence. He makes a great addition here and has the best lines in the film. <p>By the time Dantes returns to society as the Count, the film diverges wildly from the story. The revenge Edmond seeks here is too pat and too easily resolved. In the book, his vengeance is intricately planned and executed slowly over many, many pages. By shortening this sequence, the filmmakers sacrifice the suspense of the novel to time constraints and a waning attention span common in today's moviegoers. To be fair, the movie never tries to be a literal interpretation of the book (or so says screenwriter Jay Wolpert in an interview on the disc). In some ways, deviating from the book does make the story more compelling. The sword fights are great fun to watch, especially the final showdown between Dantes and Mondego. The scene where Dantes provides a way out for Villefort and then pulls back at the last second is a nice touch as well. Overall, although I think more elements of the book should have been kept in the story, the movie succeeds.<p>Many extras on the disc make this well worth picking up. There is a short documentary about Alexandre Dumas, a location documentary, four deleted scenes with commentary, a film commentary from director Kevin Reynolds, a detailed explanation on how the sword fights were shot and choreographed, and an interview with writer Jay Wolpert. The picture quality and sound is top notch. I recall that this film disappeared from the theaters quickly, perhaps due to an aversion for period pieces or competition from one of those effects laden clunkers they foist on us every few months. I found "The Count of Monte Christo" entertaining and technically well done, and would certainly view it again.
 B000063W1R, A3L2U581LL17EB, Eric, 26/27, 4.0, 1032307200, A spirited adventure., This most recent adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel isn't going to please all the fans, particularly those who demand rigorous adherence to the source material (I never did understand such people's way of thinking; a movie is never bad just because it strays from the source) but it most certainly will please moviegoers in the mood for a period piece adventure, and as such a film, The Count of Monte Cristo never fails to entertain for every bit of its running time. <p>Jim Caviezel stars as Edmond Dantes, a rather poor and uneducated man who has a life that his rich friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) envies. Dantes has just been promoted to captain of his ship after he and his crew returned from a brief, unanticipated stop in Elba, where Napoleon had given Dantes a letter to give to a "friend." Mondego is particularly jealous that Dantes' fiancee is Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), their childhood friend who has grown into an utterly beautiful woman. <p>Mondego sets out to destroy Dantes life by telling French officials of the letter, which leads to Dantes' arrest. He is banished in a prison located on an island rather far from the mainland. As the years pass, another prisoner, Faria (Richard Harris), actually tunnels his way into Dantes cell. With his help, Faria believes they can dig to the outer wall, and in return, he will teach Dantes how to read, write, and fight with a sword. As soon as he makes his escape, Dantes plans his vengeance against those who betrayed him.<p>There's actually a LOT more plot than what I've stated, which probably already sounds hefty, but there are a lot of things I'd rather not give away. While not without some flaws, The Count of Monte Cristo is rousing entertainment and is probably the best period piece adventure in recent years (personally, I found it more enjoyable than The Patriot, Rob Roy, and The Last of the Mohicans). <p>The film's first seventy minutes represent marvelous entertainment, consistently gaining momentum with every scene that goes by as we grow more and more compelled by the story. The film stumbles only slightly in the third act, when Dantes eventually encounters all those who destroyed his life so many years ago, and sets in motion a plan for his own vengeance. It's in this lengthy segment that a few moments drag (but only a few) and some scenes feel a little hard to swallow (that Pearce's Mondego wouldn't recognize Dantes). The climax feels a little silly, in that seemingly all the lead characters pop out from nowhere to either fight or reveal long-held secrets. <p>But thankfully, such flaws are only mild and hardly detrimental. This is a well-acted, well-written, and surprisingly well-directed tale of revenge. As Dantes, Caviezel excels, making a believable transformation from a kind-hearted, innocent man to one whose heart has been hardened through so many years. Guy Pearce chews the scenery quite well as Mondego; he seems to be having a great time playing the greedy antagonist. It's nice to see that Pearce, who usually plays likable characters (as in L.A. Confidential and The Time Machine), is up to the task of giving us a villain to hiss at. <p>The other performances aren't quite as vital, though Richard Harris is good as Faria, and Luis Guzman is often hilarious as Dantes' right-hand man (the scene where Guzman tells Dantes how to handle the massive amounts of gold they just found is the biggest laugh I've had all year). Dagmara Dominczyk is pretty decent, though her acting is mostly overshadowed by her beauty, a back-handed compliment, I suppose.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo actually doesn't feature that much in the way of adrenaline-pumping action. Despite all the claims this is a swashbuckler, there are only three swordfights (and one knifefight), and each of these scenes last no longer than maybe two minutes. But the appeal of this film isn't in the action, it's watching a plot that unfolds with little twists and turns that, though often expected, engaged me because I cared about the situation and the fate of the characters.<p>There was obviously a lot of work put into the way this film looks. The cinematography is gorgeous and the sets are magnificent, with splendor I have rarely seen rendered so well in period pieces. The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds, who may yet have a career again after his critical disaster, Waterworld (which actually wasn't half-bad). Highly recommended, The Count of Monte Cristo is great fun all the way.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****
 B000063W1R, A1Z9OQG9GZ26X2, Joboo, 31/34, 4.0, 1011139200, The Count reigns down revenge, Not since Mask Of Zorro have we had an old fashioned revenge movie that played on classic cinema rather than tendency of movies today to be loud and bloody. I was fortunate to see this movie with a sneak preview audience. <p>James Caviezel is fantastic in the role of the Count. He is very believeable as a simple, humble man in the beginning and then the torn, angry, revenge seeking Count later on. The movie has many similar elements to the aforementioned Mask Of Zorro, but has enough of its own identity for you to note the similarities, but not be distracted by them. The beautiful actress Dagmara Domincyzk plays the love interest. There are many closeups of her face and she is stunningly beautiful and convincing. Guy Pearce is a more than able bad guy, successfully creating a character that you come to despise thoroughly by the end. <p>The audience that I viewed this with absolutely loved it. There are sprinkles of light comedic lines throughout the film and the audience was delighted with them all. The scenes where the Count is exacting his revenge registered the loudest response from the audience, as many were very vocal in their approval of the revenge being dished out.<p>It had been a while since I viewed a movie where the audience broke into a loud ovation at the end. This one received such an ovation and I concur.
 B000063W1R, A28ILXH590CMRJ, Hazen B Markoe, 24/26, 4.0, 1012003200, James Caviezel leads the way in a solid MONTE CRISTO, Alexandre Dumas' classic adventure novel of revenge and romance, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO has been endlessly made and remade in various films and TV series.  It's no wonder as the book's themes of betrayal and payback are timeless.  Kevin Reynolds directs a solid and full blooded version of this classic that features a star-making turn by James Caviezel in the title role.  Caviezel never hits a false note in his role of Edmond Dantes, the sailor sent to prison on trumped-charges and who eventually escapes to seek his revenge on the 3 men who conspired against him.  Caviezel easily handles both the innocence of the young Dantes and the bitter cynicism of his vengeful alter-ego. Richard Harris, who is making a cottage-industry of playing quirky supporting roles, provides warmth and humor as the Abbe' Faria, the fellow prisoner who mentors Dantes. Dagmara Domincyzk is lovely as Mercedes, Edmond's fiancee.  However, Guy Pearce, who plays Dantes' romantic rival and former friend is a little too over-the-top with his mincing and sneering portrayal.  At one point, I began thinking he needed a top hat, handlebar mustache and cape to complete the picture.<br />  Filmed on location in opulent locations in Malta and Ireland, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a feast for the eyes.  At one point, the Count makes a grand entrance in a hot-air balloon that clearly illustrates his power and mystery.<br />  The screenplay is a solid enough adapation of the rather long novel, although it does throw in a couple twists that were not in the original.  After Dantes appears in his Count identity, the pace of the film really takes off as plotlines are shortened and tightened. The action scenes are also top-notch.<br />  THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is an entertaining and fun swashbucklng type of flick that they just don't make any more. As such, it is easily the best film of this genre since THE MASK OF ZORRO which, in an ironic twist, also used elements of Dumas' novel. I definitely would recommend this film to adventure lovers and romantics everywhere.
 B000063W1R, A2VOIE123XM7T5, G M. Stathis, 28/32, 3.0, 1029110400, A Good Film-But Not the True "Count", "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas is one of the great adventure novels of all time, and one would think that it would be the perfect story for an adventure/supense/period film.  Indeed, Kevin Reynold's version is the latest in a long line (the Hallmark televised version may be the best).  Sadly, none of them have done the written work justice.  True, the novel is a complex and detailed work that would require a rather special treatment on the screen. Reynold's version is a good movie, but honestly it is not "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Far too much dramatic license has been taken here in changing the story, the characters and the ending.  Significant characters were left out, parts of the story are not even aluded to, and some things were added to create a "hollywood" ending (no, the book ends much differently than this film...and it is far more satisfying).  This film is nicely photographed and produced and is largely well acted (except for the portrayl of Napoleon which does not work...oddly enough Napoleon is never actually "seen" in the novel, he is always off-stage, so to speak).  Enjoy this film for what it is, then treat yourself and pick up a copy of the novel.
 B000063W1R, ADX5JX5LKLC22, Intro Spective, 30/36, 5.0, 1011312000, BREATHTAKING...THEY JUST DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE, Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.  This was simply magnificent in every possible way. The acting, script, cinematography were stunning.  I just want to say something:  Todays moviegoers want mass market drivel.  This is art.  But at the same time it's an exciting, action-packed, plot AND character driven story during which any viewer with a heart and a soul will be on the edge of his or her seat.  JIM CAVAZIEL, if there is justice in this world, will become a HUGE A-list leading man as a result of his BRILLIANT performance. No other actor out there could have played the Count in this movie; he was made for this, his role of a lifetime, and he deserves an OSCAR FOR IT.  Guy Pearce, so sexy and sympathetic in his previous roles, is so believable as a villain in this movie, that one walks out of the theatre despising his fictional self - sorry Guy this just means that you are a GREAT ACTOR - and big things are waiting for him as well - all actors in this movie are extremely talented and are irreplaceable.<br />PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE, ONE AND ALL - ITS OSCAR CALIBER,CLASSIC STUFF**DO NOT BE DISCONCERTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THE STORY - IT'S A NEW, MODERN, ORIGINAL TWIST - IT'S EVEN GOT SOME COMEDY - A MUST - SEE! AND I'VE SEEN EM ALL...I WILL PAY TO SEE IT AGAIN.  AS ABOVE, AN AUDIENCE FULL OF MANY JADED PROFESSIONAL MOVIE CRITICS GAVE IT A STANDING OVATION AT CLOSING CREDITS...
 B000063W1R, AA09N6UF7K8AC, Alexandra N., 13/14, 5.0, 1073520000, Book Nazis need to chill, I have read the (unabridged) Count of Monte Christo book at least 4 times and can quote many of the scenes and dialogue. However I am not a literalist when it comes to Hollywood, because movies are not a literary medium. The best we can hope is that Hollywood captures the essence of the book, which I believe the makers of the Count of Monte Christo have done - and done very well.  While I agree that it is not a faithful retelling of Dumas' original, it is a fine film that captures the heart of Dumas' message: Vengeance is, (and should be) the Lord's. <p>Ultimately, Dumas' novel was about the ravages of revenge, both to the avenger and to his victims. Director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter Jay Wolpert's celluloid rendition captures that message in a way that is both entertaining and beautiful. Unlike many Hollywood films these days, this one has charm and heart, which allowed me (an avid movie buff) to overlook its occasional imperfections. <p>Jim Caviezal plays the tortured Count with aplomb. His metamorphosis from guileless youth into the brooding, devilish Count is convincing. No small feat considering young and old Dant&egrave;s are polar opposites. <p>Guy Pearce plays the treacherous libertine, Mondego, with a light, foppish touch, making the character all the more frightening. His lines are the best in the film, vicious and manipulative, but delivered with sardonic self-composure.  <p>Richard Harris was the right choice for the Abb&eacute; Faria. During Dant&egrave;s' bleak imprisonment, Harris lightens the screen with his earnest optimism and sharp wit. He is more animated than in his recent role as Dumbledore in Harry Potter, even fencing with Caviezal, despite his advanced age. <p>Dagmara Dominczyk is lovely as Mercedes, but of course lacks the vapid self-immolation of the character in the novel. Hollywood loves tidy endings so she is reunited with Dant&egrave;s while the Persian princess, Haidee, (Dant&egrave;s' real paramour at the end of the novel) is not in the film.  Still, Dominczyk's elegant grace is winning, despite the weepy dialogue she is sapped with. She and Caviezal are what movie stars should look like. <p>Luis Guzm&aacute;n is fun as the Count's dutiful sidekick, Jacopo. Not surprisingly, he is the film's comic relief and acts as a bridge between our generation and Napoleonic France. His lines are more modern slang than classical prose, but it works, especially with Guzm&aacute;n's East L.A. lilt. <p>Reynold's and Wolpert had no easy task - adapting one of the world's favorite stories to the Big Screen.  Of course, the novel is a much more complex and philosophical work than the film, and that is to be expected. A true adaptation would likely be 4-5 hours long. And, yes, they have taken liberties with the book - the ending especially. Still, the movie stands on its own as a stirring and inspiring tale of treachery, romance, revenge, and repentance. It is one of my favorite movies ever, and that's saying something, since I hate almost everything. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
 B000063W1R, A13TO1ZFAH9SVN, Matthew Edmundson, 14/16, 5.0, 1067990400, Fantastic Swashbuckling Tail, This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo. It doesn't follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others. It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes. A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit. He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau'If.(thats not how you spell it but it's close enough for me) It's there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature, economics, and swordplay. Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail.<p>This is a great story of revenge. Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes. He does a great job. He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he's rich. He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character. I'm really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future.<p>Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego. I was first impressed with Pearce in L.A. Confidential. It's good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again. He plays a great bad guy. You can't stand his character and that's because Pearce plays him so good.<p>This is an awesome tail of revenge. If your a diehard Dumas fan you won't like this. I'd reccommend the Richard Chamberlin version for you. However if you like a fast paced tail of revenge full of swashbuckling this is the film for you. It's a great action film that reminds us why we go to the movies: To Be Entertained. You'll like this one.

If you like",Get Back," movies this is a must see.<br /><br />The Counts character starts of as a vindictive person ,when released from his prison,but learns to forgive to save the thing he loves the most.
 B000063W1R, A1VE2B3RHJQZHM, shirley, 0/0, 5.0, 1339113600, A production very well done!, I purchased this dvd for two reasons.  One , I've read the book many times, and it is a classic. I have seen many of the other productions, and I wanted too see how this one compared.  Two, I am a BIG fan of Jim Caviezel, and wanted to see his portrayal of the Count.  I was not disappointed on either count! It was timely and acting very well done.  I had seen this when it first came out, but seeing Person of Interest every week, I decided to buy the Count.  Great dvd for<br />a fan!

The problem is the movie is more UNLIKE the book than it is like the book.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie of the book itself, you will want to look at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OSGR68">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>

The acting that James had to partake, one day being Edmond Dantes, the next being ED in Chateau d'If then, then Counte Monte Cristo then again to ED in the prison...amazing how he kept his composure back and forth during the shoot.  Will watch only knows how many times. The book maybe better but that goes into great detail where as a movie can only be so long. Oh well, I will be happy with this DVD.  Too bad DVD's dont always want to add the bleeps and blunders.  Get to seee the seriousness or goofball side of an actor.

The colors seem much more vivid and the sound much better. I think I could watch this over and over but never grow tired of it.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the movie because it doesn't follow the book close enough. I agree that it doesn't follow the book closely, but that shouldn't detract from one's love for the movie. The full book is 1100 pages. It would be impossible to put that into a single movie. They would have to make it 3 separate films like Atlas Shrugged is being done.<br /><br />This one is totally worth it.

As if Dumas' books are sacred writ...so many struggle to find any value in an adaptation.  If you ask me this movie was far more entertaining than either the book or any of the earlier films of the same title.  I enjoy a great rewrite.

When one friend betrays another, it sends the main character life in a downward spiral.

 B000063W1R, A1NISD0L3OTTYH, Donna Rambo, 0/0, 5.0, 1283644800, The Count of Monte Christo, The movie is excellent in all respects; however, the company, MovieMars, is not.  First they sent an unusable CD due to it being the wrong Regional area.  Then when I sent it back, at the expense of $5.43 mailing fees, they refused to reimburse me for the postage.  They refunded the original fee for the CD, but not the postage for return fee.  They claimed I should have known what Region I am in and which CD would or would not work on my machine.  Well -- I have been renting, buying, and borrowing CDs for about 15 years and have never had this experience before.  I believe the CD they sent was meant for foreign markets and they should have known which one to send due to my return address.  Anyway -- they were nasty about it, and until I get the postage refunded to my Visa account, I will not be ordering from them, for sure, and probably not from Amazon.  After all, Amazon is the company that is truly in charge here.  Thank you.

The action involved and the forgiveness given to his love was not in the original book but I would not have enjoyed the movie unless he allowed for this change.  The original book was a bit morose.
 B000063W1R, ANCOMAI0I7LVG, Andrew Ellington, 0/0, 5.0, 1279152000, Blood, sweat and tears..., You can place this in that `far better than I remembered it being' category.  `The Count of Monte Cristo' is fun, exciting, intelligent and suspenseful, far more than I expected it to be and far better than I remembered it.  Having recently indulged in this forgotten gem once again, I'm finding myself kind of giddy.<br /><br />This movie is fun.<br /><br />If you are into the classic adventure films like `Swiss Family Robinson' and `Robinson Caruso', this film is right up there and certainly just as engaging.<br /><br />You know, my initial dislike for this movie was probably plagued by a heavy dose of bias.  My parents lauded it, and so that is usually sparks an initial reaction of discomfort.  I mean, I pride myself on having better cinematic taste than they do, and so when they recommend something to me I'm usually hesitant.  Still, they saw the movie twice in the theater and encouraged me to accompany them on their THIRD trip to the movies.  I begrudgingly accepted the invitation.  Now, mind you, I don't think that Guy Pearce or Jim Caviezel are great actors.  Capable, yes, but no where near `great'.  I think that also clouded my appreciation for this film.<br /><br />I was also merely sixteen when this film was released, so I kind of have an excuse for judging films with sharp bias.<br /><br />Still, I did enjoy the film enough to buy it later on a whim and I've watched it several times since then.  Upon my most recent viewing I found the film elevating drastically for me.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of Edmond Dantes, a middleclass sailor whose friend, the wealthy Fernand Mondego, is surprisingly jealous of Edmond's good fortune.  He has recently been promoted to captain of his vessel and has become engaged to his girlfriend, the ravishing Mercedes.  Spurned on by his jealousy, Fernand betrays his friend, concocting an elaborate and viscous scheme that lands Dantes imprisoned in the torturous Chateau d'If.  While in prison he bonds with a fellow prisoner who teaches him to fight, as well as articulating him, teaching him to read and write and converse as a gentleman.  Then he informs him of a hidden treasure and tells him the location.  Once Edmond finds a means of escape he uses his newfound knowledge to create a disguise, allowing him to exact revenge on the men responsible for his loss of thirteen years in prison.<br /><br />With ravishing and passionate performances, stunning visual prowess and a sharply constructed script that breathes an air of believability in a premise that is undoubtedly far-fetched, `The Count of Monte Cristo' is nothing short of grade-A entertainment and serves as further proof that first impressions aren't always correct.
 B000063W1R, A3C7H0F73YXNTS, Jennifer V. West "Colorado Chipeta", 0/0, 5.0, 1274659200, Great Customer Service, Arrived quickly and excellently packaged. DVD in even better condition than description. Very happy.
 B000063W1R, A2XUIU2GOMA68G, Carlos Donoso Kronfle "-CDK-", 0/0, 5.0, 1270598400, Revenge is a dish best served cold..., And even though the above quote is not taken from this movie, it did remind me a lot of it as I was watching this film. I could see this movie plenty of times and not get bored of it thanks to its clever script and wonderful acting by all personnel.<br /><br />You probably know by now what `The Count of Monte Cristo' is all about so I will not bore you with the subject matter of the film. But what I will say is, if you enjoy seeing the enemy get no mercy -not necessarily getting killed- and thriving for vengeance at its best with witty `traps', then there is no exception for you to miss out on this movie.
 B000063W1R, A3EFCK0HZQPNQI, Geoff Puterbaugh, 0/0, 4.0, 1270080000, A fun and absorbing movie..., While this film may not make it into the "classic" category, I've surely seen a lot of movies which were much, much worse.  This one is colorful, well-acted, and tries its very best to do justice to the sprawling plot of Alexandre Dumas' 1200-page novel.<br /><br />Of course, as any screenwriter has learned, it's not just difficult but impossible to shoehorn a huge novel into a film.  Therefore, entire swathes of the novel's plot wind up in the waste-basket, characters are blended together, and so on.  The one alteration I found most interesting was the story of the grand love affair between the Count (Edmond Dantes) and Mercedes.  In the novel, the two lovers face up to the decades of betrayal and part ways.  As I recall, Mercedes retires to the country or goes into a convent, while Edmond frees his "Greek slave" and marries her.  In this movie, Edmond and Mercedes forgive one another and go on to perpetual bliss. (There is no "Greek slave" --- she wound up in the wastebasket with all the other stuff, including the lesbian runaways.)<br /><br />I really think (and hope) that this whole business of turning novels into movies is going to learn something from Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" --- or from the TV mini-series.  Producers should STOP chopping and maiming the original story to cram it into a narrow time frame: they should take just as much time as needed to tell the complete story.<br /><br />Of course, that's just me sayin'.  :-)<br /><br />This is a good movie!  But it could have been a lot better!

 B000063W1R, A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ, Mark, 0/0, 5.0, 1262822400, God give me Justice!, One of my favorite movies of all time. James Caviezel is excellent in his role as the count. Set on revenge for a serious injustice he ends up with some good fortune that runs his way while in prison. Sets the rest of the movie to plot against the very men that caused his demise. Great Movie!

The movie flows well and the story (though familiar) is interesting and exciting.  The story, "The Count of Monte Cristo", inspired other great works and movies such as the movie, "The Shawshank Redemption"- one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />This movie will appeal to all ages.

 B000063W1R, A3GV24GH1AFXDJ, FaithOryx "Always Searching", 0/0, 5.0, 1258329600, Love love love this movie., I realize that this movie is different than the book. I have read the book and I loved it.<br /><br />However, that being said, this movie, standing alone, is AMAZING. I cannot complain. Every time I watch it, reading is the last thing from my mind. This has all the elements of a good action movie- a fantastic intrigue, believable and fun characters, lots of exciting twists and turns and action sequences, a solid and sweet romance, revenge, sword fights, smugglers, mercenaries... I could just go on and on.<br /><br />I have seen this movie so many times and will watch it so many times again. I wish Hollywood could make more movies like THIS one. I rarely get to see a good old-fashioned historical epic that I love like this.<br /><br />I refuse to dislike it because it's so different than the book. I think it's an interesting and modern take on a classic story of revenge. I feel the SPIRIT of the novel the entire time I watch the movie, and that's what matters to me.<br /><br />I just want to say this movie had an EXCELLENT cast and I think that's what helped make the movie so amazing for me. It was the delivery of the lines and the timing of the actors that made it glide so smoothly. I felt like the ACTORS believed the story and were really committed.<br /><br />In a small but much-needed part, Michael Wincott is perfect in his role as the prison overseer. I love him as an addition to any movie I've seen him in (this role reminded me of his part as Sir Guy in Robin Hood- another amazing part). Of course, Richard Harris as Priest was as perfect as over and very animated! Guy Peace has fun with his role as Fernand- he is so delightfully sarcastic, arrogant and manipulative. Though he played his vulnerable side so well. Luis Guzman and JB Blanc should also get recognized for making this actual revenge plot of this movie happen- they are involved as mercenaries and friends of the count in almost every revenge scene. They are both funny, interesting and believable in their roles. James Caviezel stole my heart away as Edmond... he really played the transition of the character SO well, both in emotions and in the age of the character. I could hardly recognize Edmond as the Count from Edmond the innocent youth. Also, Dagmara Dominczyk was fantastic, though admittedly, I know little about her. I must say, she was given a sappy part (she cries in most of her scenes) and she handled that demanding role well! She was beautiful and sweet. James Frain is one of my all-time favorite actors, though he is not a megastar. I simply adore his acting. He plays a gray villain in this movie- not quite a total bad guy but certainly has his share of bad deeds. It was fun to see him in this part for sure. At first I was surprised at him being casted for that role, but I just came to love the part.<br /><br />Give this movie a try and just sit back and enjoy. The plot is solid and just complex enough. The acting is superb. It is not a perfect recreation of the original novel but it IS a perfect capture of the IDEA of the novel. Revenge was never so sweet!

So being the fact that I am always looking for a good movie I ordered it from my work computer. Upon watching the movie I was very happy with my dissension to buy it. Since it was old it worth more buying than renting. The movie it self is very detailed and very satisfying. The ending felt like an ending where some movies I've seen just leave me saying (That was a waste of time) I would recommend this movie to anybody it has action for myself and drama the my wife really got into.

 B000063W1R, A1UMSB7LAW0RIR, Writer of Books - Mage - Mom to Two "Writer, ..., 0/0, 5.0, 1248048000, This is a GREAT film, overlooked by so many, totally worth watching., My brother suggested we watch this.  Normally I don't care for his  movie choices because he loves Star Trek and action films.  WOW, this is a  GREAT MOVIE. I think the only reason anyone would give it less than ten stars :) is that they do not pay close enough attention in the beginning. SO, without spoilers I will explain the beginning....<br /><br />A man is in love and also has a best friend.  The man gets a promotion at work (basically) and when he does...he proposes.  Soon after, he is approached by Napoleon (no, this is not a boring history film, not at all!) and is asked to carry a letter to someone.<br /><br />The man is caught helping Napoleon and put in a horrible, underground prison.  He makes a friend there (a priest) and spends all of his time plotting revenge.<br /><br />Well, I can tell you, this movie is one where you get to the end and say "Wow, I wish I could watch that for the first time AGAIN!"  It's great!  But you do need to pay attention in the beginning...BUT DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE BEGINNING.<br /><br />Everyone we watched this with was trying to chat during the beginning. (Family from out of town.)  Just pay attention.  Once he is in prison, which is pretty soon, it really loosens up and is a beautiful, fun film.
 B000063W1R, A22QDGL361UBG8, Khayriyyah Ali "Jamilah Aromatherapy", 0/0, 5.0, 1243641600, One of my FAVORITE Movies with moral lessons to be learned, This story, written by Alexandre Dumas tells a tale that is as classic and contemporary at the same time as it likely was upon its release as a book in Paris in the 1800s. It is also a tale that almost anyone might find something of value in which to identify. There is innocence, intrigue, revenge, honesty, romance, devotion and narcissism among other personality traits, for good or bad, and clarity around some of the same topics and moral questions experienced by the many vivid characters in this drama. When innocent people go to jail as a result of corruption and a love of materialism, who is to fault? As sophisticated as life was in Paris at the time for people of means, it was rife with corruption.<br /><br />The movie is excellently scripted, wonderfully acted, and truth is, I just can't watch it enough! Everytime I watch it I get something or see something else in the story that hadn't emerged in my mind earlier. Of course, there are several parts of the film that are my favorite-- if you'd care to know one: look for the Count when he introduces himself to French (Parisian) society with his "Greetings."<br /><br />I recommend this film for people of ALL ages. If you'd like to experience what life was in France during the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, I also recommend this movie. It indeed provides a good history lesson in addition to the moral lessons to be derived from the experiences Dumas captured so eloquently in this masterpiece!
 B000063W1R, A27GP310AJR9JI, Roger L. Sayer "Lenedwin", 0/0, 4.0, 1243123200, Could have been better, This addition of the famous story is mostly to be recommended. The acting is first rate and 'Mercedes' is a knock out. The movie works very well even though it doesn't follow strictly to the book. My only criticism is it's scanty treatment of the part of the story where Dantes ( The Count ) rescues his old employer and friend from ruin by setting him up with a new ( replica of his original one ) boat. This is one of the central parts of the story and deserved more screen time than it got.
 B000063W1R, A39CX0EE4BZCZC, Craig Connell, 0/0, 5.0, 1242864000, Revenge, Justice Or Both?, I really  appreciated this film on the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, "Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch." Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale enacted out but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through.  Boy, I hope this comes out on Blu-Ray some day.<br /><br />Acting-wise, the most fun to watch was Richard Harris as "Priest," the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel, the man (Edmond Dantes) unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Harris had some of the best lines in the movie, several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in "The Passion Of The Christ" - sermons about believing in God! That's the acting profession; one film you play an  atheist, the next you are Jesus!<br /><br />For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow, stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward, he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch, played by Luis Gusman, who still sounds like he's more at home in the streets of New York but, once again, you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.<br /><br />Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do, but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing, making enjoyable films like this. To be fair, it isn't just revenge, as this film points out, it's "justice" we all like to see. In here, the two words are interchanged, depending upon one's rationalizations.
 B000063W1R, A30PZUE2YQHXGJ, J. W. Henderson "Sky Pilot", 0/0, 5.0, 1242259200, Really Great, This movie is top notch. The acting and filming is excellent, as is the story line. It conveys a message of hope, eventual justice, the futility of grudge-bearing and the merits of generousity. The action is attention holding and the movie has no dull spots. I watch it on average once per month.

 B000063W1R, A3VC1CIRFDXJAY, Teresa "SWEETHEART", 0/0, 5.0, 1238976000, THE POOR SEAMAN, BECOMES  A MEGA RICH COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO!, This is one of my favorite versions of the count of Monte-Cristo! I just love (James Caviezel) as Edmund Dantes; he is a beautiful, handsome man! If you love hidden treasure, pirates and seaman, and adventure, and romance, then this movie is just for you!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, it is a story about a poor, innocent and handsome seaman, who gets charged with a crime that he did not commit! His rich best friend Mondego, betrays Edmund, with the help of Dangler(the ships first mate) they are very jealous of Edmund.<br /><br /> Villefort, a powerful and deceitful man joins forces with Mondego, and puts Edmund in prison, and charges Edmund with crimes that he did not commit! Mondego ends up marrying Edmunds sweetheart(Mercedes), while Edmund is in prison.<br /><br />After several years in prison, Edmund becomes bitter and seeks revenge, and with the help of a fellow prisoner (Richard Harris-the priest), Edmund learns how to read and gets a education and learns how to sword fight! The priest helps Edmund escape, and gives him a hidden treasure.<br /><br />Then Edmund is rich and free! And seeks revenge! I just loved this movie, a definite must see movie!
 B000063W1R, A2PKRPEODLQSH1, McLisaDiva "Lisa", 0/0, 4.0, 1231891200, The Count of Monte Cristo -- great fun for my birthday!!, I purchased The Count of Monte Cristo for my husband for Christmas but we ended up not watching it until my birthday just a couple of days ago -- what a great way to spend my evening. I loved all the action, the period costumes and scenery is very authentic, but the best part was actor James Caviezel -- he is great. (This is the same guy who played Jesus in "The Passion of Christ".) The only negative thing I would say is that the count got a little too hard (mean) with his revenge plot. I would recommend the movie and think it's worth even watching again.
 B000063W1R, A3A4WQL80WOTMH, C. Rocklein, 0/0, 4.0, 1231718400, Revenge Fantasy Fulfilled.., ..and that's gotta be why it was enjoyable. *SPOILERS*<br /><br />I haven't read the book, or I'm sure I'd be giving it fewer stars, but for what it was, I was pulled into it and happy the fantasy ended happily.  Let's face it, you want him to get his revenge, get the girl and live happily ever after.  Who doesn't hope for that?  Also, the lead actor Jim Caviezel, who plays the loyal then betrayed Edmond Dantes is a sypathetic and likable character that you have no choice but to route for.  It's as if he's getting revenge for you!  Not to mention the scenery was beautiful. Beleivable or great art, this may not be, but it was an entertaining enough movie.
 B000063W1R, A273SGLDMWWZ66, P. Hawley, 0/0, 5.0, 1220745600, DVD Purchase, It was so easy to buy the DVD I was looking for, The Count of Monte Cristo, on Amazon.com!  Even ColumbiaHouse did not have it!  I entered a search, got instant results, looked at the reviews, chose a seller and ordered a used but "like new", DVD. It arrived in just days and was in perfect condition!  I'm very happy with the seller and with Amazoncom!
 B000063W1R, A1GHUN5HXMHZ89, C. A. Luster "The Rook", 0/0, 4.0, 1217203200, The Count of Monte Cristo (2002), James Caviezel, Guy Pierce, Richard Harris, Luis Guzmain, and the rest the cast give great performances. Under the astute direction of Kevin Reynolds the pacing is good and you truly get a feel for the events. The costumes, sets, and music are well done and add to the illusion of being there. This is a classic and remarkable Alexandre Dumas story of a common man falsely accused and imprisoned. His escape and revenge will have most people cheering or at least on the edge of their seat. The action seems almost non-stop but even the slower moments have good character development and help clarify the story. A fair amount of time is spent with Harris's and Guzmain's characters which helps develop them. The amount of treasure he finds is overwhelming. I highly recommend you catch this version. Although I have not read the book, this version inspires me to do so as I have a feeling it follows it more closely. Good quality DVD with great replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "The Man in the Iron Mask" and "The Three Musketeers". - C. Luster
 B000063W1R, AAVLB0GGEKRCO, Andrew Raker, 0/0, 5.0, 1201305600, Excellent fast paced film!, This Buena Vista film version (spoken in English) of the Count of Monte Cristo is a very fast-paced DVD version of Alexander Dumas's novel of the same title. James Caviezel and Guy Pearce's performes are both well-performed.<br /><br />I could imagine James Caviezel as the Count of Monte Cristo as pictured in Dumas's novel. The remainder of the characters also fitted their roles well, especially Danglars, Villefort, and Mondego.<br /><br />It is true that this film version is meant to display acting, especially plot sequence. It therefore does not allow the characters time to develop the way that Dumas's book did. However, this film does present most of the major aspects of the book that are most important to remember.<br /><br />The revenge sequence at the end of the film does GREATLY variate from the book. For example, Villefort is arrested, Danglars is also arrested, and Mondego dies in a duel. This is not exactly what a BBC drama afficianado might want to see, but then again, no one has ever accused Buena Vista of attempting to mimic the BBC.<br /><br />Overall, if you want to watch the book on DVD, I would advise you NOT to purchase this DVD. However, if you are willing to watch a film that is relatively entertaining, with good acting and well-designed sets (yet not altogether loyal to Dumas), than this might be the film version for you.<br /><br />Otherwise, the Koch Lorber Films French version of the Count of Monte Cristo (1999), starring Gerard Depardieu might serve your purpose better - especially if you know how to converse well in Francais (French).
 B000063W1R, A88PY6TRF86XF, Casey J. Chalk, 0/0, 4.0, 1198886400, A solid movie but will dissapoint any who have read the book, I originally watched this movie before reading the book, and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Friends of mine who had read the book scoffed at the movie for its simplicity and consistent straying from the book.  I have been reading the book for about a month now (and am only about 2/3 done!) and decided to buy the movie, since the book was so entertaining. I have to say that I now agree with my friends - there is simply no way to adequately tell the story in a 2 or even 3 hour movie.  The shift from Edmond Dantes to the Count of Monte Cristo and his various other personalities (Sinbad the Sailor, the Abbe Busconi, etc.) is such a dramatic one that it would require more of a series-type film to sufficiently portray it.  I'm thinking of something similar to "I, Claudius," "the Jewel in the Crown," "Band of Brothers," etc. You only have to read a couple hundred pages of the book to understand what I mean - it is almost as if the producer would need to hire two separate actors: one to play Edmond and one to play the Count (or one hell of an actor, no disrespect to Jim Caviezel, who still does a fantastic job).<br /><br />It is not that this movie is a poor one; far from it! The story-line is entertaining, the acting strong, and the writing intelligent.  But this movie is simply not the story of the Count of Monte Cristo.  So many changes have been made, and incredibly significant ones! Entire characters and subplots have been entirely ignored, and those characters or subplots that remain are often entirely changed.  For example, Edmond's interaction with the smugglers directly after escaping is an entertaining one, but it is not even in the book!<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, I suspect you'll find this movie a delight; if you've read it and remember any amount of details, you'll be bewildered much of the time.  I haven't finished the book, but I'm told that the ending is also entirely different! But to those who can get past the "it's not as good as the book" syndrome and understand that a 2-hour movie can never compare to literature, I think all can find this enjoyable.

 B000063W1R, A2PC9EFEVC8W59, J. R. Herring "Pickled", 0/0, 4.0, 1168300800, The Count of Monte Cristo, Very entertaining movie.  I've watched it a number of times and always enjoy.  I got this copy for my granddaughter who is seventeen.  We watched it together.  There's not all that many movies out there that you can watch with your granddaughter.  Try this one.
 B000063W1R, A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ, Larry Scantlebury, 0/0, 5.0, 1148428800, "Where is mercy?" "I'm not a saint.", This is one of my favorite movies. Granted it was only released four years ago and I've probably seen it 4-5 times. I find, not necessarily in this order, a strong sense of fidelity to the original book. While this may seem faint praise, when you compare it to the disasters of Musketeers and Iron Mask, this film is brilliant.<br /><br />The movie addresses the intrigue of the time. The Bonapartists, the Republicans, and of course the Star Chamber proceedings absent witnesses and certainly absent justice.<br /><br />Edmund Dantes is imprisoned not for something he did but for something he knows. And the prosecuutor who sentences him conspires with Dantes' friend to arrange a Hitchcockian 'man on the train' exchange of murder most foul, Villafort sentencing the unknowing Dantes to life or death in Chateau d'Iff, a watery prison-grave and Mondego, lusting after Dantes' bethrothed, Mercedes, to murder his Villafort's father, an embarrassing Bonapartist.<br /><br />The movie reeks of post revolutionary Paris and you get a palpable sense of the times. Dangerous times, but times when a man of revenge and money might make his way.<br /><br />We feel for Dantes once he escapes from prison, on the one hand rooting for his victory while on the other, saddened by his consumption of hate. Even Mercedes asks him to relinquish his hate and he tells her, surrounded by wealth, 'it's all I have.'<br /><br />Caviezel is brilliant as the brooding wronged man, articulate and well trained by his colleague in prison, Father Faria (Richard Harris), with his rage and torture so very close to the surface.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is excellent as the promiscuous, unscrupulous Mondego, and kudos must be given to Luis Guzman, who is always good, and Harris, who is always brilliant.<br /><br />You can't miss. 5 stars.

 B000063W1R, A2NUHWMHA9XNKV, Lady Raven RAVE!, 0/0, 5.0, 1148428800, (;D)....(:D), This movie is really good. It is a little long, but it is totally worth it. It's exciting, emotional, dramatic, and captivating. Everyone should see this one!
 B000063W1R, A25HYPL2XKQPZB, Bill Garrison, 0/0, 4.0, 1148256000, A lavish, fun adventure.  A classic novel and a great film, The Count of Monte Christo stars Jim Cavizel in the last big movie he did before taking the part of Jesus in the Passion of the Christ.  No matter how long this movie is, it will always be short to do the book and the full story justice.  Most people however, will not read the book, so this movie must be evaluated on its own.  Cavizel is Edmond Dantes, a young sailor awarded the captain's role of a merchant vessel.  His fiance is thrilled but his best friend Mondego (played by Guy Pierce) is jealous.  On their last voyage, the ship had made a stop at Elba where Dantes and Modego talked with Napolean.  Mondego used this meeting and the help of a jealous sailor named Danglars to frame Dantes for treason.<br /><br />Despite th attempted frame, Dantes is about to be let go when the government attorney Villefort has a change of heart.  That night, Dantes is sent to prison not knowing why.  His fiance Mercedes and Mondego plead for Dantes life, but Villefort refuses to release him and even tells them Dantes has been executed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dantes languishes in prison questioning God and his will to live.  Soon, Dantes meets a priest who tunnelled into Dantes' cell mistakenly while trying to escape.  They become best friends and the priest teaches Dantes everything he knows about life, the arts, fighting and even tells him about a hidden treasure.  Soon Dantes escapes from prison.  At his point the movie is half over.  The second half of the movie portrays Dantes transforming himself into the Count of Monte Christo for the soul purpose of getting revenge on those who wronged him.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the movie, yet it is too short to give proper attention to the revenge schemes Dantes uses or to show how is character has changed over the years.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, colorful movie to look at with great acting and adventure.  This is a classic story and I recommend this movie (and the book).  Some downfalls I noticed were Cavizel's portrayal of Dantes after he escaped from prison.  Now after reading the book, I think Cavizel's portrayal was accurate, but the movie didn't last long enough to give it justice.
 B000063W1R, A1BZZNC5DJG3TZ, Dianna Rollo, 0/0, 5.0, 1011830400, Good entertainment!!!, Director Kevin Reynolds keeps you pleasantly entertained with light humor in the classic story of the Count of Monte Cristo. I look forward to seeing this movie again.
 B000063W1R, A2TD13LRUGU46X, Grant McKee, 3/5, 5.0, 1087171200, Count on a Great Freakin' Movie, I must confess that I have not read the book that this movie is based on.  I did enjoy the few Dumas stories I have read, though.  Most people that give this movie a big thumbs down have read the book and, rather unrealistically, expect a perfect translation of a 900+ page book into a film with a run time of just over 2 hours.  Obviously, that's not going to happen.  So I'll just tackle the film itself.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo hit the theaters in early 2002, arriving with all the fanfare of...well, you know when the grocery store gets a new shipment of cereal?  Less than that.  But sometimes the smallest splashes result in the greatest impacts.  The Count of Monte Cristo came out and reminded the few who saw it that a movie can have a great, cohesive story with superior acting and entertain without being either pretentiously arty or exceptionally lowbrow.  As I said, all of the actors are great:  Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Richard Harris, Tom Everett Scott, Luis Guzman, Michael Wincott, etc.<p>If you're looking for an accurate adaptation of the novel, this probably isn't your place, but if you're looking for an entertaining, epic film with action, intrigue, betrayal, revenge, and even a dash of comedy, you can't do much better than The Count.
 B000063W1R, A2Z71PNFQ40HF6, "ja7000", 3/5, 5.0, 1034726400, Better than the book, This is the first time I have preferred a movie over the book on which it was based, something I thought would never happen. The movie is only loosely based on the Dumas novel. Some reviewers have complained that the movie is not true to the book. It would be impossible to make it true to the book in a two-hour period. There are so many subplots in the book's 118 chapters that a movie would have to be several hours long to portray it faithfully. <p>While I loved the book, I actually liked some of the departures from the original storyline. When reading the book I wanted to sympathize with Edmond but found it harder as the story went on. In the book Edmond in the end is a rather unlikable, arrogant character (despite the good he does). In the movie he regains the decency he had before his imprisonment. In the book he abandons Mercedes to a life of loneliness despite her obvious love for him and settles down with a girl young enough to be his daughter. In the movie he reunites with Mercedes. In the book he harms people who were not responsible for what happened to him and doesn't care about consequences until a woman and child end up dead as a result of his behavior. In the movie he metes out justice and harms only the people who deserve it. The movie is a great moral tale, a great struggle between good and evil. In the book the line between good guy and bad guy is blurred, and Edmond becomes, in many ways, no better than Fernand, Danglars and Villefort. By removing the moral ambiguity I feel that the screenwriters have actually improved on what Dumas wrote, which is rare for film adaptations.<p>This appears to be a fairly low budget movie, so be prepared for some imperfections, such as the lack of great background music that I would have expected of a period piece. I also agree with some reviewers that Fernand was miscast. Having said that I still highly recommend buying this movie.
 B000063W1R, A16HYHVQIFMRP6, Bonnie-Ann "bakesq", 3/5, 5.0, 1025568000, Literature comes to life, There is simply no other word to describe the newest visual version of this great classic but Magnificent!  The Count has always been one of my favorite literary characters and he is brought to life -- a true storybook treatment of the original novel.  The scenery, sets, direction, cinematography and every other aspect of this film are beyond comparison with any other movie my husband and I have seen in the past several years.<br />  The movie sweeps the viewer away from the very first moments, incorporating historical characters and events into a story which develops and broadens as the movie progresses.  On the night I saw this film (my birthday -- my choice), I had received a painful shot to ease torn muscle pain in my arm.  My husband and I really debated whether we wanted to go out at all simply because I wasn't in the mood to do anything.  But I had so wanted to see this movie since I first saw the previews that I decided to brave it (we already had a sitter lined up too).  By the time the movie was 15 minutes in, I had forgotten the pain, relaxed back in my seat and was totally enthralled.<br />  We are very picky about the movies we go to see and have not been overly impressed of late with the selections available.  We would usually rather stay home and watch one of our 2000+ VHS tapes or growing collection of DVDs.  This film was so incredible, we went back 11 days later and saw it again (something we never do except occasionally with Star Trek movies).  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes romance, action, adventure, period pieces and tremendous storytelling.
 B000063W1R, A1FYYU65Q436C2, Cory R. Tuinstra, 3/5, 4.0, 1180828800, Better Movie than Book, I found that the movie version of Count of Monte Cristo was much better than the book. While yes, they do differ,the book leaves you hanging while the movie closes perfectly. So if you are going to invest time, go with the movie, it's a better bet.

 B000063W1R, AEXVGEMTTOXV9, Teacher, 1/2, 5.0, 1168473600, The Count of Monte Cristo, A movie worth watching numerous times.  An excellent cast which contributes complexity and depth to this historical fiction classic.  The movie excels at various levels.  It will remain as one of our family's all time favorites.  Everyone we have shown the movie to, in turn, snatches my movie and shows the movie to others.  I have purchased additional copies.  Appropriate for various audiences.  Tasteful and timely humor.  Not one expletive.  Eloquently executed.  Exciting and satisfying resolution.

 B000063W1R, AI2G6ZZS0G00Y, Lynne P. Caldwell, 1/2, 5.0, 1143331200, The Ultimate Revenge Movie, We've seen many of these revenge movies and the COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a compilation of them all. Oh, and throw in a little of the illiterate and naive country bumpkin who becomes educated by the kindly older gentleman during an undeserved incarceration and we have a great film. This movie is reminiscent of Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean and all the good swashbucklers that we have come to enjoy. James Caviezel does an outstanding job of playing Edmund Dantes, the honorable and kindly young man who is wrongfully accused of treason by his jealous best friend.<br /><br />Abb' Faria (the delightful Richard Harris), another prisoner befriends Dantes during the thirteen years he is imprisoned.  This priest not only educates Dante, but also gives him a map to a great treasure. When Dantes escapes he finds the treasure and then begins his quest of retaliation against those who betrayed him. We all like vengeance movies where the 'bad guy' gets theirs and MONTE CRISTO is one of the best! The scenery, costumes and acting are all top notch and the little love story is also highly enjoyable.
 B000063W1R, A2KWFGHX2PKJJB, C. J Peters "Anne", 1/2, 5.0, 1093392000, Stunning!(...), I absolutely loved this movie! The music, the story, everything.  Of course, James Caviezel was gorgeous. And, Guy Pearce was a real looker too. Movies are so much fun when there is a bad guy who is just rotten to the core. Don't you just love when there is a villain you can just hate and enjoy hating? Each bad guy got what he deserved, and they got it good! The humor was priceless. This is a flawless movie. So, it's not the original. BIG DEAL! He got the women, the kid, and some sweet revenge. If that doesn't make a good movie I don't know what does. The original didn't have any of that. Did I mention that the action was delicious? And, that sword fight at the end was quite enjoyable. All I can say is if you haven't seen this one you don't know what you're missing!
 B000063W1R, A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R, Traveler, 1/2, 5.0, 1079568000, Quality Extra Features: The way DVDs should be made, Many reviewers have commented on the movie so I'd like to focus exclusively on the features of the DVD.<p>So many times you you get a DVD and the &quot;extras&quot; consist of the trailer and the choice of sub-titles.  Other times you luck out and get what appears to be cool behind-the-scenes documentaries.  What you get, in fact, are hammy interviews with the cast and crew as they go about their business of making the movie.  And most of the explanations of the more technical aspects are as about as in-depth as you'd get on Entertainment Tonight.  <p>There are exceptions, of course, such as the first Matrix which offered details about how they created the special effects in the movie.  But it seems these kinds of extras are the exception and not the rule.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo is a pleasant surprise because it truly offers interesting background information that a fan of the movie would want to watch.  <p>A discussion with the screenwriter as to how and why he adapted the script from the original Dumas book was very interesting.  And the short bio on Dumas was a nice surpise.  And unlike other DVDs, this one offers not only deleted scenes, but also commentary about why those scenes were deleted.  Perhaps the only mundane portion of the extras was the &quot;layer-by-layer&quot; audio design segment which took a specific scene of the movie and split the sound into dialogue, sound effects, and music.  But even then, this would be of interest to people who want to learn more about how movies are made.<p>This is a DVD for people who want to know more about the movie and its subject.  I only wish other DVDs were as good as this one.
 B000063W1R, A34X0JH8GU1TCL, orbit13 "orbit13", 1/2, 4.0, 1079222400, Alone, an intriguing film, but short of Dumas' novel, Reimagining a classic is always a gamble, and this one may come up short if you're expecting a full-scale revision of the original.  Dumas' tale of love, justice, and revenge cannot fit into 2 hours, and this movie attempts to abridge even the most abridged version of the story.  Edmund Dantes (Jim Caviezel) is falsely accused of treason, thanks to jealous and conspiring friends (Guy Pearce and James Frain).  He finds himself imprisoned at Chateau d'If during his engagement to Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk).  Upon his escape from the island, he vows revenge, doing so with unlimited funds from a sunken treasure and under a new guise, the Count of Monte Cristo.  Dantes' friends, now wealthy and successful, are at first taken by this new count, until he proves to be less of a gentleman than they expected.<p>With all the action and cunning, or because of it, the pacing seemed rather hurried, perhaps because the novel is juicier; for all his 13 years in prison, Dantes exacts his justice rather quickly, leaving little time for emotions on both sides to seethe and boil.  The film focuses unnecessary time on Dantes' imprisonment, in spite of Richard Harris' fine performance as a fellow prisoner and a priest who teaches Edmund and later directs him to the treasure; his character is immediately forgotten following Dantes' escape. In condensing the story, however, the script manages to draw out jealousies born of a lifelong friendship between a commoner, Dantes, and a noble, Fernand Mondego. Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce fill out their roles exceptionally well.  In less skilled hands, their characters might come dangerously close to self-parody.  Still, the script provides only a faint shadow of Dumas' rich novel.  <p>The DVD comes stocked with extras, including a biography on Dumas and a study of the novel. There are also deleted scenes, a director commentary, and a segment on the adaptation.  I would have liked some interviews with Caviezel and Pearce, however.<p>If you enjoy the story but not the 200 hours of reading you'll need for the book, you should check out the French miniseries filmed a few years back starring Gerard Depardieu.  It's much more faithful to the original, and the added time allows Dantes' revenge plots to precipitate at a delicious pace.

Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.  <p>Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly.  This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).  <p>Truly a classic and a must read.
 B000063W1R, AHQYCRL2FMG3D, Joseph Valentine Dworak, 1/2, 3.0, 1032825600, Sleeper Hit, Great flick for a Saturday night during the winter.  The camera work and filmaking were excellent, Italy and France never looked so good from the sea.  The actors were good, the novel was represented fairly well, and this movie moves along at a good pace.  The classic themes of revenge, adultery, deceipt, redemption, father vs. son, friend vs. friend, lover vs. lover, are all in this movie.  While this movie will not win a ton of awards, compared to so much of the low quality movies out there today, this movie definitely receives a grade of &quot;B&quot; or higher.  Worth seeing.
 B000063W1R, A1HX00DL0SZM1G, Darren Harrison "DVD collector and reviewer", 1/2, 4.0, 1032393600, Not as good as the 1978 version but some great features, This most recent adaptation of the famous novel is a little slow and meandering in the first third of the movie, but following the appearance of Richard Harris - like a mole rising from the ground - the pace quickly picks up and explodes as the lead protagonist wreaks vengeance on those who betrayed him earlier.<br />The movie is not as effective as the 1978 version which starred Richard Chamberlain in the lead role, but what it does have in evidence is some truly interesting features. My favorite extra feature on this DVD is the documentary which recounts the adaptation of the story and why the screenwriter made the changes that he did.<br />Well recommended.
 B000063W1R, AWMI8T6T8R0Q5, MsEsq, 1/2, 5.0, 1032307200, Excellent Date Movie, I never heard of this movie until someone mentioned he was named after the Dumas character in this novel.  I haven't watched the 1934 version but I have the TV miniseries with Gerard Depardieu [in French with English subtitles] and this latest version.  Of the two, the movie was definitely a notch above [both due to the choice of actor and the screenplay adaptation]. <p>I just wished I watched it with the someone beside me!
 B000063W1R, ASM49K4PPX7EA, Nicole Barlow "Nico", 1/2, 5.0, 1032307200, Exceeding Expectations, If you have read this classic tale by Alex Dumas, you won't be disappointed! This is a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up until the very end! It will exceed your expectations, I promise you! Jim Caviezel makes a great Dantes and Pearce's dialogue is truly amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 B000063W1R, A2WB4OWBUH2VQX, HardyBoy64 "RLC", 1/2, 5.0, 1032220800, WOW!, I read the novel this summer, in anticipation for the release of this movie and after watching the film, I realized that the movie can stand on its own merits.  At times, however, my knowledge of the novel did cloud my perspective of the film, but the quality of the acting, the scenery, and the storyline is much higher than the majority of Hollywood films.  I strongly recommend both the film and the book. Yes, there is liberty taken in adapting the classic book to the screen, but you simply cannot portray the complexity of the novel in a 2-hour time frame. This is a great movie, and Dumas' classic novel is a great book. No question about it.
 B000063W1R, A1KFBAPAKMEQUF, L. Jerome "jamdown", 1/2, 5.0, 1032134400, Wonderful Underhyped Movie, Never heard of this movie until my husband brought it home.  It was wonderful!  Thoroughly enjoyable this tale of a wronged man who takes sweet revenge on his enemies, while reigniting a lost love.<p>Why have I never heard of this film before? Surely the lead should have been nominated for an Oscar.  This film was a little violent, but can be enjoyed by the entire family.  A true gem.
 B000063W1R, A16837CKPTA07O, P. Rudnicki "cynderela23", 1/2, 4.0, 1031702400, New Movie Old Adventure, Have you ever found yourself thinking,&quot;They just don't make movie's like they used to.&quot; If so, The Count of Monte Cristo will become a hit in your household!<br />  When I was young I remember watching Eril Flynn Movies with my Father and being totally transfixed to the television! The fight scenes would take my breath away, no special effects needed. Now in a world of movies like The Matrix, and Blade, it seems every action movie that comes out has to have UNBELIEVABLE special effects to be a hit. That is not the case with The Count of Monte Cristo, it's an old action story told in a realistic way.<br />  Alexandre Dumas's works have never failed to inspire filmmakers to make his stories into movies. The success of The Three Musketeers and The Man in the Iron Mask have proven that, The Count of Monte Cristo is no exception.<br />  This epic tale of heroism begins with two boyhood friends coming home from sea, Edmond has been promoted and can finally afford to marry his true love. Unfortunatly his friend also loves the same woman, and has Edmond put away in prison on false charges of treason to keep him from his lady love.<br />  Years later, Edmond escapes from his prison, with a little help from a friend he met inside, and quite a bit of money, revenge fresh in his mind.<br />  I will not give away the ending to this great story, but I will say it makes a great movie and I highly recommend everyone watch it.
 B000063W1R, A2ZLROGIL2V7GV, Michael Crane, 1/2, 5.0, 1030752000, PHEW!!!  What a relief!, I wrote a review for this DVD, but it never got posted for some reason.  I gave it one star because I was under the impression that this was going to be released in FULLSCREEN only.  At least, that's what was listed on this page.  But now, I look on this page and it says WIDESCREEN format.  YES!  PHEW!  Okay, now I WILL buy this movie, because  it is an excellent one.  And looking at the special features listed, the DVD itself looks promising.<p>I will most likely write another review once I get the DVD and am able to explore the special features.  Just wanted to say how glad I am to find out that the whole FULLSCREEN situation was a terrible mix up.  I just hope that THIS isn't another typo.
 B000063W1R, A2PV19AS7V6JY3, K. Johnson, 1/2, 4.0, 1024963200, The Book/The Movie, I thought the movie was great, but if you decide that you love the book above all things, don't see the movie. I saw the movie before I read the book, and I really enjoy them as seperate things. The movie itself was fantastic and I really didn't find myself sitting there saying "This is so stupid, I can't believe I paid [how much?]to see this" or "that could NEVER happen". And Guy Pearce is the greatest.
 B000063W1R, A1655SGPPUUCRP, Emily Todd, 1/2, 5.0, 1019692800, One of the best films of 2002!, "The Count of Monte Cristo" is a lavish adaptation of the 1845 Alexander Dumas novel. The film stars Jim Caviezel as Dantes, a sailor framed for treason by his supposed best friend, Fernand (Guy Pearce). But why would anyone frame his best friend for treason? Well, poverty stricken Dantes has something rich and powerful Fernand does not; love. Fernand wants Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk); Dantes true love, for himself. Thus, Fernand concocts an evil setup, framing Dantes for treason. Dantes is then imprisoned on the cruel island prison of Chateau D'lf for 13 years, where he transforms from a lighthearted sailor to a bitter and angry man. While at Chateau D'lf, he plots revenge against those who betrayed him.<p>Richard Harris also puts forth a quality performance as Abb&eacute; Faria, another innocent prisoner. With the help of this strange old man, Dantes escapes the island and transforms himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo after following an old treasure map to a load of treasure on the island of Monte Cristo (thus the "Count of Monte Cristo). Becoming rich and powerful is the first step in Dantes revenge.<p>"The Count of Monte Cristo" is such an enjoyable film mainly because of the sweet satisfaction involved in watching Dantes execute his revenge on Fernand. Revenge is always an exciting thing to watch! The audience is able to identify with Dantes and sympathize with him. You may even find yourself becoming as obsessed over exacting revenge as Dantes! My point is; you are really drawn into the story, more so that any film in recent memory.<p>"The Count of Monte Cristo" brings in some intriguing aspects of Dantes personality about midway through the film. When Dantes returns as The Count of Monte Cristo, he sees that he could have a perfect life if he wanted to. His love, Mercedes, still wants to be with him and he now has all the money he could ever need. Yet Dantes pushes it all away. He must complete his revenge. It has now become clear that Dantes has become obsessed and can no longer look at the world in a rational way. It's really quite painful to see what Dantes has become.<p>"The Count of Monte Cristo" boasts an intelligent screenplay, lavish sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb action sequences, beautiful music, superb directing and stellar acting.
 B000063W1R, A3FX9KYW53MRBD, Susan Hinojoza "It's a full life.", 35/56, 1.0, 1038441600, Should be Locked in Chateau D'If!, Classics remain beloved for hundreds of years because they are wonderfully crafted and contain universal truths that still speak to us. The director and producer of this condescending adaptation of Dumas' classic story must feel that the modern American audience doesn't have the intelligence to appreciate great classic works.<br /><br />Oh, the basic story line is there--man is wronged, man goes to prison, man escapes, man finds treasure, man seeks revenge. But that is where the homage to this great work ends and the often ridiculous changes are made. I know that it is cliche to say that the movie is not as good as the book. In this case, however, I can't believe they actually had the audacity to call the movie by the same name as the classic novel which it so minimally follows.<br /><br />One can excuse some adaptations of a novel when produced as a screenplay, but the changes made in this case lose all the beauty and terrible power of the original story. Instead of a wonderful slow burn with a lot of atmosphere as Dantes slowly and painstakingly weaves a web of revenge for the wrongs done to him, we have stupid devices like a flamboyant entry in a hot air balloon, complete with Cirque du Soleil acrobats twisting on the ropes. Instead of an intricate plan to destroy the personages who wronged him, we have swashbuckling sword fights every few scenes.<br /><br />Some major characters are missing completely (such as Valentine) some have been shamelessly changed and substituted (Jacopo for Ali). The final plot device is totally contrived and NOT in the book--we find out that Dantes has a son sired on Mercedes before he was arrested. I guess the screenwriters felt they had to put some sex in the story or no one would like it.<br /><br />I awaited this production eagerly; having now seen it I feel disgusted and insulted.  If you want to see an intelligent production of the Count of Monte Cristo, avoid this movie like the Black Death. It would be better to lock the DVD in the Chateau D'If. If you haven't read the book, you may enjoy it, since you won't be dissapointed by what is lacking. It does have good scenery and filming, although some of the acting is terrible (Jacopo especially).<br /><br />To the director and producers: for shame. Nearly everything about this movie was wrong, wrong, wrong. Give the American audience some credit for pity's sake. We can appreciate great works just as they are.
 B000063W1R, A2ZQ75P93V9MX9, Ryan R. Grant, 4/7, 4.0, 1109721600, Well done drama, creative re-interpretation of the book, This movie is excellent as a movie. As far as following the book not so. However let's be honest: If this movie were to be faithful to the book, it would be 100 hours long! There are over 200 characters in the book, and several sub-plots that are unable to be adapted to cinema accurately. If one is a purist, don't watch movies based on books! You will always be disapointed. The job of someone adapting a book for Cinema, is not necessarily to reproduce the book in exact detail (which in most cases is impossible unless its a tv miniseries that can run all week). It is to reproduce the essence of the story, and find those things which will make for the best film. That's tough when you are constrained to 2-3 hours of film.<br /><br />The Count of Monte Christo presents the essence of Dumas' story, a man betrayed by his best friend, learning the skills to survive in prison from a priest, also unjustly imprisoned, and returns to exact his revenge, and in the process, he learns that revenge is not worth it. The acting, costume, music, cinematagraphy and sword play is second to none, and the movie is quite entertaining.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that they spend a lot of time building up God, and religion and morals, then present fornication and adultery in a positive light because Dantes and Mercedes "Loved each other", which as a Christian I had a problem with. Maybe that doesn't bother the non-religious viewer, but it presents a contradiction to me that is at best difficult to reconcile and at worst ruins the moral impact of the movie.
 B000063W1R, A3LFFFKJEO2ZFK, Janis Ann "Jan", 2/4, 5.0, 1124409600, Superb, I was blown away by the incredible adaptation of a familiar tale.  Jim Caveziel was hauntingly sensitive, only to turn fearfully vengeful.  His nemesis, and former best friend, Guy Pearce, hinted at a carefully concealed malice before indulging in a fearsome betrayal.  Everything in this film works. The sword play in this Alexandre Dumas swashbuckler is awesome.  The sets, the costumes, all combine to seduce the viewer.  Furthermore, the DVD extras are excellent, both informative and entertaining.  I can remember Richard Chamberlain's Count from the 70's, I believe, and I did not expect to ever see a better one.  But I was wrong.  This film is better.  A definite must-see,which I somehow missed when it was released.
 B000063W1R, A30LQLFU8JFDPM, C. D Smith "dogstar49", 2/4, 2.0, 1079913600, Changed the whole tone of the thing by changing the end, I agree that it may be necessary to change parts of a story to make the 2 hour limit common to most movies.  I think that the ending (without giving it away, if you care) goes counter to the vengence theme Mr. Dumas was weaving.  So as to who the Count winds up with may be an issue of what is acceptable to the movie industry racially, and it may just be a simpleminded simplification.  If you've never read the book, read it.  It is melodramatic.  The ending in it makes more sense than the end of this movie.<br />As an aside, I think that Mel Gibson must have seen this movie and settled on Mr. Caviezel as the lead after seeing his portrayal of the imprisoned Edmond Dantes.  He is whipped 3 times in the movie and is made up to look astonishingly like the Jesus he portrayed in Gibson's movie.  Looks like he is being type cast.
 B000063W1R, A3TXNSN0LN4CRC, Film Critic, 2/4, 5.0, 1022630400, This Movie ROCKS!, I recently watched this show at the movie theater that gets all the movies later and charges [a cheaper rate] to watch them.  Well, because of that, I just recently saw this movie.  In fact, I saw it the day before I watched Star Wars Episode II, and a bit after seeing Harry Potter, and Spiderman.  Well, of all these films, The Count of Monte Cristo was the best!  Funny how my original expectations kept me from watching it as a new release...  Highly recommended!
 B000063W1R, A7Y6AVS576M03, gobirds2, 2/4, 3.0, 1015804800, Count by Numbers, For all its production values and sweep this version of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO remains insipid. The characters are thumbnail sketches, which lack all the depth necessary to convey the true meaning of this story. There is no sense of revenge, lost love or even enlightenment of revealed secrets. Instead of really feeling sympathy for the wronged Edmund Dantes you may actually feel disdain for his naivete. Richard Harris brings some life and period humor as Dantes' mentor and prison mate. This portion of the film is very good being well developed and structured. However, when Dantes escapes and returns as the Count it seems like the rest of the film got compressed to fit it into a pre-determined time slot.
 B000063W1R, A1ESIMERJCCX6, themadbaroness "laurnie15", 2/4, 5.0, 1013817600, what is wrong with you people????, i would just like to say wake up it is a movie. even though it does not go along with the book it is still a good one.  who cares about it matching the book. alot of movies don't match the book. and movies that match the book are not exciting any way you already know what is going to happen yea!!! if you know already why do you need to see a movie about it. get over yourselves.  i personally think that this movie had a great ending and not to mention some really hot guys.  watch a movie to watch a new good movie not to watch a redo of an old book.
 B000063W1R, A3S1N6O1HAURLJ, Elena, 2/4, 4.0, 1012867200, Fabulously done!, After seeing "The Lord of the Rings" 4 times in the theater I saw a preview and thought I would go see this one.  First let me say that this is a wonderful movie!  At first I thought it started out a little slow, but then after a little it sped up and was a 'can't take your eyes off the screen' type of movie.  However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was expecting more action-as in swordplaying.  Well actually I was expecting another "Mask of Zorro" movie(Antonio Banderas).  That was the first movie that came to my head while waiting to see "The Count of Monte Cristo".  But I suppose they wanted to make it for a variety of audiences instead of just for the action movie type of people.  I think that they did a very good job.  Like someone earlier said, this movie works on all levels.  This movie is perfect for anyone.  But seeing that I have never read the book I obviously don't have an opinion on what it looks like to them.  But for those of you who don't know the plot line it is very unpredictable and exciting and worth seeing.
 B000063W1R, AED6N2DP65192, Robert Gyepes "Magyar gyerek", 10/17, 1.0, 1082073600, The Count of Monte Cristo, While this maybe an entertainig movie for the ones who have not read the book, it is an abomination for those of us who cherish one of the world's greatest classics.  It is like Romeo and Juliette getting married and live happily ever after.  There are indeed beautiful scenes, good acting and an appealing story the movie is not really reflecting the book.  I was thoroughly disgusted walking out of the theater. I would very highly recommend the 1974 version with Richard Chaimberlain as a much better film
 B000063W1R, A2VN0HXQR27YF, Heather Butler "litgraduatestudent", 5/9, 2.0, 1137628800, Dumas is rolling in his grave..., The Count of Monte Cristo is probably one of my favorite books. Its numerous, but inter-connected plot lines are filled with suspense, romance, and "you know you had it coming" revenge. The movie adaptation of this novel was awful. Except for the title, character names, and a few other details, there is nothing in the movie that resembles the original. The movie only focuses on the struggle and revenge of Edmound Dantes, which turns out to be a watered down version of the book's. No amount of fight scenes would have saved this movie. Plus, the ending is completely different!!!!<br /><br />I would only recommend this movie if you plan to NEVER read the book. If you have read The Count of Monte Cristo, DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE! It will only disappoint you. Like it did me.
 B000063W1R, A103VZ3KDF2RT5, "asfaraster", 5/9, 1.0, 1083715200, A disappointment for book fans, If you read and loved the book, then most likely this movie isn't for you.  The only similarities between the two being Dantes imprisonment and escape.  I have yet to see a movie version of the Count of Monte Cristo that gets the story right, the closest being the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version, but even that one had it's flaws.  A summery of this movie would be Edmond Dantes' life is ruined by his greedy friend, but after tweleve years in prison, Dantes comes back, gets his vengence, and Mercedes and his life goes back to how it was twelve years ago.  The book is so much deeper, and this unrealistic fairy tale ending makes the whole movie feel flat.
 B000063W1R, AZ289K8AEXF21, Vicky, 5/9, 5.0, 1037577600, Use this movie for teaching!, I have used the DVD &quot;The Counte Of Monte Cristo&quot; in religion class to give the teenage students a deeper understanding about 'Sins' and 'Virtues'.<br />The character of Fernand Mondego is an example of a sinful man who is filled with: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed and sloth.  On the 'virtuous' side is the character 'Edmond Dantes' he displays the virtues of: humility, kindness, abstinence, chastity, patience, liberality and diligence.<br />The movie poses some great topics for the students to dialogue over and they are excited to discuss it in class.  I would however, show this movie in short segments of 30 minutes.  There is plenty of material to keep your class in discussions for several weeks.
 B000063W1R, A1MJ2N6XARKOFQ, Darreld E. Studie, 0/1, 5.0, 1336003200, Love this Movie, This is a great if somewhat inaccurate rendition of the book by Alexander Dumas. The disc arrived in the condition described and very quickly. I am happy.
 B000063W1R, A2KW1R12GJO3BI, lparkerbaldi, 0/1, 5.0, 1326672000, Great gift, This was a gift to my boss. A favorite movie but he & his spouse could not find their copy. They would reach for the movie & find an empty case. Ever happen to you? They were both thrilled to get the video. I was happy that it came perfectly on time for the Christmas holiday.
 B000063W1R, A112UYCJEYZPIP, Michael S. Whitman "michaelwsf", 0/1, 5.0, 1323820800, One of My Favorite Movies, I love, love, love this movie!  The acting is superb, especially the relationship between Edmond and the priest.  This movie has it all - romance, friendship, family, betrayal, murder, prison, escape, love, poverty, wealth, etc.  I've watched this at least 20 times and will watch it again someday soon.
 B000063W1R, A2DB5YBO8INXWZ, Mark, 0/1, 5.0, 1322784000, The way movies based upon books should be!, I'll start off by saying that the book is one of my all-time favorites and is well worth the read.  But don't expect the movie to exactly copy the book.  The book contains far too much detail and plot turns to allow it all into a movie that could be viewed in one sitting, so why even bother to try?<br /><br />The movie starts with the same premise as the book, it veers off into a new and refreshing direction.  While it retains the same flavor, it differs in many of the details.  The result is a wonderful story, optimized for the screen, that keeps those who know the story well very entertained and not quite sure what's coming next.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel's performance in this movie is excellence in acting.  He displays the misery and agony well when needed, then moves onto a focused, calculated and emotionally-repressed Count.  Excellent acting in one of the most difficult roles imaginable - right up his alley.<br /><br />Luis Guzman's Jacapo makes the movie.  The role of the character in the movie does an excellent job of helping to "explain" the Count efficiently.  Nearly each line that comes from Guzman's mouth is memorable - the quality of his performance alone would have overwhelmed many lesser movies.<br /><br />The action, effects, score and other items that you'd expect from Hollywood are all there - in sufficient quantity without overwhelming the viewer.  It definitely should have swept the awards in 2002!!
 B000063W1R, A21TCW8DZTOJKS, Renee Turner, 0/1, 5.0, 1314489600, great acting, great story, This is a beautifully done rendition of the<br />classic. This screen adaptation is better I think than the novel. The screen version has a more cohesive plot and it has a happier ending.  It is a great family movie despite the sword fights and other intense scenes of violence. There is a lot of humor and romance but there are serious lessons taught as well without being preachy. My children range from age 10 to 17 and they all love it and quote from it all the time. This recent purchase was a gift. We have gifted several copies. It is one of our favorite movies.
 B000063W1R, A26WR0278FJD0Q, PantherDame, 0/1, 5.0, 1289433600, This is One of the Best Films I have seen in a long time!, This film has the eye candy of it's era along with the "easy on the eyes" Jim Caviezel! This man can not only act but wow can he reach down into your very being to touch you with his roles. I saw him in the movies; Frequency and Angel Eyes before this and he just keeps getting better!! He is a ladies heart throb and man's man all rolled into one. My husband took me to see this and also found this film to be a truly entertaining film from a man's point of view.
 B000063W1R, AQZH7YTWQPOBE, Enjolras, 0/1, 3.0, 1269216000, Good, but not the definitive version, This version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADFM">The Count of Monte Cristo</a> is pretty decent, for a Hollywoodized version of the classic novel. If you haven't read the novel, it's pretty exciting and keeps some of the novel's drama and suspense. James Caviezel and Guy Pearce both do great jobs portraying Counts Monte Cristo and Mondego. Some of the dialogue seems forced, especially when compared to the intricacy of the novel. This Hollywood version also has a lot more fight scenes to appeal to American audiences.<br /><br />However, I think the Gerard Depardieu <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BFJM26">The Count of Monte Cristo</a> is much better. First of all, it's much longer (400 minutes), which allows the revenge plot to really thicken. Second, the Depardieu version stays more faithful to the novel. If you really want to watch a film adaptation of the novel, and have the time for it, I recommend the Depardieu instead of this one.
 B000063W1R, A2ZHLRZA2UHKNN, Bella "Bella", 0/1, 3.0, 1236643200, Count of Monte Cristo, Great Sale, however it was not in very good condition bc there was writing on the DVD.

 B000063W1R, A3C9RIZVADD3B6, mathwonk, 0/1, 2.0, 1233360000, well this has almost nothing to do with the novel, Unfortunately I have read the 1400 page novel and seen the movie versions starring robert donat and gerard depardieu.  hence this version is a trivial adventure flick, with nothing at all of the magic of the classic.<br /><br />this might serve as an entertaining movie to a modern viewer with no idea what the real novel has to offer.  this is less faithful, hence less sophisticated, even than the classic comic book version.
 B000063W1R, A2AZOD3HG2EL5N, C. O'Hala, 0/1, 5.0, 1213920000, Excellent -- a "must see"!, A timeless masterpiece! A great story with terrific actors, brilliant dialogue in a beautiful location. Both Dantes (Jim Caviezel) as well as his evil friend, Mondego (Guy Pearce) were outstanding. Also the close relationship between Dantes and the Priest (Richard Harris) so touching. And who could forget Jacopo (Luis Guzman)?! Everyone I have shown this film to  (young to old) love it. You will not be disappointed!
 B000063W1R, A2GMUNBN9HKRZS, John D. Aldridge, 0/1, 3.0, 1206835200, Watchable, but not satisfying, The original story by Dumas is a timeless classic. For me this film is not a great adaptation. Much of the film occurs in "Dark-o-Vision"...using only natural light or candlelight. Perhaps more realistic, but frustrating for lack of details to savor, and confusion during several action sequences. There are several outdoor scenes that have radical changes in lighting. The end duel occurs in bright sunny daylight and dark cloudy weather, all in a matter of minutes. The lead character just doesn't seem to have the from the gut passion he should have. Actually the leads are just quick sketches, and not allowed enough  time to become more than just puppets.I think too much precious screen time in spent in the set-up. This time should have been better spent in the social/educational/fighting re-awakening prison training sceens, especially when you have such an interesting and fascinating actor such as Richard Harris as the instructor. The delicious machinations of revenge, and the crushing realisation when the original betrayers are destroyed are not here, to be enjoyed by us or the protagonist. When he finally during his escape "gets even" with the whip wielding warden it is confusing and not satisfying for us the audience. Yes, revenge is wrong, and that message is reached at the conclusion...but it is a major audience pleaser, "the money shot" and shouldn't be glossed over, nor ultimately condoned. The swordfights were well choreographed, but filmed in a confusing manner, and without pace. For me the only part that reached wonder was when the Count first appears, in the balloon. But even that scene is quickly ended on a flat note. This is where the storey should start to reach an exiting level, allowing us and him to revel in his new rich and glamorous lifestyle, but always with the anger simmering underneath. There is some great location photography. Wonderful costumes. Good effort, but does not do the Dumas story justice. This is just my opinion, and does not mean any more or less than any one else's.

 B000063W1R, A2A3L2QLRWD5F4, Guy R. Gingras, 0/1, 5.0, 1163203200, One of the, Best movies I have purchased.... betrayal, deception and the power of love.... wow worth the cost ***********
 B000063W1R, AVRA2OVCB1K5I, TropicMD, 0/1, 5.0, 1151971200, The Count of Monte Cristo, Cool action movie.  The ultimate revenge.  After wrongly suffering 11 years imprisoned, Caveziel plans retribution for his alledged best friend whose jealousy forces him too far.  Some elements are unbelievable...an old priest teaching sword fighting, a lucky treasure map leading to abundant riches, everything falling into place perfectly, but who cares...it was a lot of fun and great to see the count win out over his jealous nemesis.
 B000063W1R, AT7DYVPTAY36C, Richard A. Smith, 0/1, 5.0, 1085702400, James C. and the Count, An excellent movie. Exceptional performances by entire cast especially Caviezel and Richard Harris. Intriging and moving. Have watched it several times.
 B000063W1R, A1VQNX0TFZZPCD, L. Magee, 0/1, 5.0, 1081987200, WOW!, I owned this DVD from the time it came out, but finally just got around to watching it. I was interested to see more films with James Caviezel after watching &quot;THE PASSION&quot;. I am go glad to have finally taken the time to see it. The DVD was great and this is definitely one that I'm glad to have in my very extensive collection!!! If you haven't taken the time to see this before now, then by ALL means, do so! You will not regret it, and I guanrantee the time will fly!!
 B000063W1R, ADLN37B0153N, Silmarwen, 0/1, 4.0, 1078444800, A Good Film, But the Book Was Better!, Edmond Dantes (James Caviezel) had the perfect life: Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), a beautiful woman who adored him, a rising career at the shipyards where he was just promoted to first mate, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), his loyal best friend, and who knows what other blessings on the horizon.  Until it was all taken from him.  A chance meeting with the exiled Napoleon (Alex Norton) placed him under suspicion of treason.  However, J.F. Villefort (James Frain), the local head politician, believes Dantes is innocent.  It appears that Dantes will be able to put this whole nightmare behind him, until Villefort discovers that the message Napoleon gave him was intended for his father.  Desperate to hide his father's loyalty to Napoleon and to keep his political career going, Villefort sends Dantes to the Chateau d'If, a prison where people are sent to be forgotten.<p>Dantes spends 13 years in a small cell, left alone except for a yearly visit from the sadistic warden until a fellow inmate suddenly tunneled up through his floor.  Abbe Faria (Richard Harris) had spent most of his life in d'If and had created an escape plan.  He was digging a tunnel to the outside, but went the wrong way and ended up in Dantes' cell.  As Dantes became friends with Faria, Faria became a mentor to him and taught him how to fight with a sword, how to read, and how to figure out what happened to put him in that awful place.  Faria not only gave him hope, he gave him freedom and wealth beyond his wildest dreams...<p>Dantes recreated himself as The Count of Monte Cristo and set out to get his revenge on all those who betrayed him and ruined his life.  First on his list was Fernand, his supposedly loyal friend, who turned him over to the police and married Mercedes.  Then there was Villefort, who imprisoned a man he knew was innocent so he could keep his political career.  There was also Mercedes, the woman he thought loved him, who married Fernand a few months after Dantes disappeared into d'If.  Through careful planning and evaluation of his enemies' weaknesses, the Count of Monte Cristo was able to wreak his revenge...but at what cost?<p>This movie was quite entertaining and had some things added in to the original story to make it more appealing to movie-goers, which didn't bother me, but it was missing so much of the suspense and mind games that the count played in the book.  In the book, the majority of the plot is the count carefully destroying his victims one by one without anyone ever knowing that he had a hand in their demise or guessing who he was, but in the movie, it was all over so quickly that his enemies barely had time to suffer.  Still, the actors were well cast and the scenery was beautiful.  The director did a very nice job at dusting this book off and giving it a bit of a new spin and making it appeal to the masses.  I just hope that the movie will inspire people to go and read the book, as it is one of Dumas' best.
 B000063W1R, A1EI65WJC85U68, BD Ashley "vidiot_y2k", 0/1, 3.0, 1053302400, An entertaining swashbuckler, From the producers of RUSH HOUR and the director of WATERWORLD comes this handsomely filmed adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas novel.<br />Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel) is betrayed by his friend Fernand Guy Pearce)and wrongfully imprisoned. While locked up he is educated and instructed in swordsmanship by an elderly man (Richard Harris) in the neighboring cell. Soon Dantes hatches an escape plan and sets off to exact revenge on his former friend. Dantes transforms himself into the mysterious nobleman, The Count Of Monte Cristo in order to get closer to Fernand and win his trust, thus setting his plot in motion.<br />COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is an entertaining movie, though the first 20 minutes are a bit of a bore. Pearce and Cavizel are good and the fight sequences are well done; but the pace is a bit stodgy in parts and may try the viewers patience. It's also not that faithful to the book, but this is a Hollywood movie. The people who give these movies the green light have probably never read a full length novel in their lives. It's all about the $BOX OFFICE RETURN$!$. That said, this is still far superior to previous Dumas films 1993's THREE MUSKETEERS; and 2001's inexplicably bad THE MUSKETEER and a decent way to kill a couple of hours.<br />Extras include Director's commentary, deleted scenes, dailies comparisons and an interesting feature where the viewer can play a selected scene from the movie and watch it with the dialogue, foley or music tracks playing separately.
 B000063W1R, A87RT63V7SMD3, Deborah L. Woodstuff "IntoTea", 0/1, 4.0, 1043020800, Very enjoyable for men and women...., This would be a great film to watch on a date. There is revenge. There is unending love. Sword fighting. Secrecy. Treasure.<p>Edwourd returns 13 years after being wrongfully imprisoned for treason in the horrific Chateau D'if prison. Armed with the education he has learned from an imprisoned priest (Richard Harris)and the treasure he has given him he returns to bring vengeance against those that imprisoned him. His deception is masterful.<p>Look for a hidden message as well.
 B000063W1R, A3S3HYKVSZKFNF, Grateful Soldier "Jer 20:11", 4/4, 3.0, 1107302400, Um .. ok but?? READ THE BOOK FIRST., I would say that the movie was good, but after reading the book does no justice to the Real Character of Edmond Dantes.<br /><br />By all means watch the movie!The acting for one is BRILLIANT. IT is Good as I said .. but I could not help noticing that it missed the point of the many important Characters and historical points that Alexander Dumas in the book covered.<br /><br />I only comment as I felt the book better and the movie seemed to bend and cut and paste people and events described in the book to make almost a mokery of the clear moral ground Dumas stood on in the area of Revenge and Providence.<br /><br />Makes interesting food for thought. READ the Book first. Do the story Justice Hollywood and tell it how it is. :-)<br /><br />GS.
 B000063W1R, A3TI9JJG07FY3U, "greenjade08", 4/4, 5.0, 1011916800, Excellent movie!!! Go watch it!!!, Just watched a screening of Count of Monte Cristo and I thought it was an excellent movie! It had all the ingredients--suspense, action and romance! The acting was quite good too, especially Jim Caviezel, who played the Count of Monte Cristo. It was very entertaining at all levels.  I actually felt that I would pay to watch the movie again at the theatres.  It was fast paced and not slow going at all.<p>Jim Caviezel was just excellent in the role of Edmond Dantes (Count of Monte Cristo).  I myself could not image another person playing him.  Guy Pearce was a formidable villian.  Henry Caville was excellent as the son of Fernand, Albert, as was Dagmara Dominiczyk, who played Mercedes, the finance of Dantes.  The scenary was breathtaking and Caviezel's grand entrance was one of the best parts of the movie, next to his days at the Chateau d'If. <p>Go watch this movie!!!!!!! Then, read the book after, even though there will be differences, the movie holds on its own, as will the novel.
 B000063W1R, A37GQ47VYV6Z3T, G. Taylor "Ordinary Average Guy", 6/7, 2.0, 1166313600, If it Ain't Broke........., Alexandre Dumas was a fantastic author.  The novel he wrote of The Count of Monte Cristo is gripping and fantastic.  I have read this book several times and it is exciting each time.  The movie unexpectedly changes the book's intent from the point of the Count arriving in Paris.  The changes are not necessary to meet time constraints and change the entire persona of the count.  Yet another example of Hollywood screwing up great literature.<br /><br />Films can be made that adhere to the intent of great literature while making needed changes -- the Lord of the Rings movies are all great examples of this.
 B000063W1R, A2J39S4NZE4R40, Ry "Ry", 6/7, 5.0, 1138147200, Read the Book, Seen the Movie, I will first adress the book then move on to the movie.<br /><br />For anyone who has read this book, and i mean the 1462 page book, which is the longest book i have ever read, you would find it much different than the movie. For better or for worse?<br /><br />The MOVIE has a better STORY in my opinion. Why? Because they improved on the faults of Dumas's since he couldnt finish this book. After reading around 1100 pages and nearing the end, i started to see the book i found so great, start to fade into something just "good". Could it be to Dumas tiring of writing the book? or a demand for an ending, which thus rushed the ending into something flat and not as great as 3/4 of the book was.<br /><br />If you have the read the unabridged book as i have, you may have been disapointed to find that Characters like Franz and Albert had no real ending stories, whereas Maximilian ends the story and for god knows what reason, Dumas spent so many wasted pages about Franz.<br /><br />To spend so much time and effort, dumas fell short. If he had added another 3-4 chapters near the end, he could of made the story "Great". (whats another 3-4 chapters to you when its 117 chapters...) Instead he wasted too much time on meaningless pages half way through the book and gives hints about albert being his son but never clarifies it. The ending with Mercedez was rather weak and short (in the book) and so was it with haydee. Not impressed... since a book doesnt need so many pages to make it a great one. Too many Books i prefer over this one.<br /><br />Now...<br /><br />The MOVIE, Count of Monte Cristo, excels where the book could not. It gives a better "story" overall. It takes all the good parts of the book and compacts it into a couple well good watched hours. Though i do say "hollywood" exagerates the prison part of Dantes being whipped, where in the book he is well treated. But thats showbiz for ya. The movie has a better ending in my opinion. It is sad but uplifting, whereas in the book it is sad, sad, sad, like a shakespeare book. ;(<br /><br />I dont think this Movie gets as much appreciation as it should. The movie is well adapted from the book, unlike so many "book to movie" films.<br /><br />To anyone who has read the entire book and seen this movie and thinks the movie was bad, but the book was good.... You should try and take sometime to appreciate how hard it is to take a book that is 1400 pages long and put it into a 2 hour movie. Love to see you try and make a better movie.<br /><br />So i will conclude that altough the book was good, the movie was better and Dumas would have been thrilled to know such a good interpertation was put out for the masses to watch, since few have the patience to read the entire book. If you have not seen this movie but have heard of the story before, i would recommend you see this as it is one of the greatest adventure stories of all time.
 B000063W1R, A1PILMASEE483C, kevh015 "Kevin", 6/7, 4.0, 1110844800, Excellent Movie, The Counte of Monte Cristo was extrodinary.  It is my favorite movie and some of you may wonder why I gave it four stars.  If you've ever read the book then you probably know why.  If your going to make a movie based on a book then you need to follow the book your writing it after more closely.  The movie was directed awesome and the acting was incredible.  The majority of the movie did follow the book but one of my favorite parts of the book was how Counte of Monte Cristo took nearly 20 years to spy on his oppenents and lure them into his trap.  Time is something you can't simly skip over when making a movie.  Many directors do this and in the movie Troy the same issue occured.  What made the book excell over the movie was simply that it took him so much time (more than a month or whatever).  Other than this the movie excelled in every area possible.  I could not give it any less than four stars because the only thing that needed correcting was the time frame.  If you've never seen this movie then make it a priority, it is awesome.  For those who love the movie and would be angry for me having given it four starst, please read the book and you'll see why.  A must see movie and a must read book.
 B000063W1R, AEP7IR7KT2UIA, Kettle, 6/7, 5.0, 1110758400, Superb, This is one of my all time favorite movies. No, I have not read the book yet, but, luckily, that means I can appriciate the movie for what it is, rather than what it is not. This movie was highly entertaining. It has action, drama, supense, romance, and comedy. The acting was very well done (Brownie Points for having Luis Guzman?, Richard Harris, and the Guy with the really awesome voice) and the visuals were spectacular.
 B000063W1R, A15XXOVX6ZNNRO, William D. Shingleton "Wishful Thinking Is No..., 6/7, 4.0, 1107561600, Just like the book, except for the whole concept thing, Whether you like this film or not will depend heavily on whether you have read the book and whether you believe that films based on books should follow the original text as closely as possible (for example, Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />In this particular case, the film varies greatly from the book in both detail and tone.  The overriding theme in the Dumas book is one of redemption and forgiveness; the theme of the film is primarily one of revenge.  As a result, major details in the book (who is Albert's father?  Who is Mercedes' husband at the end of the story?) are changed to keep the narrative more focused on the theme of the film.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to look at the film as a work independent of the original text, you will find an excellent piece of cinema.  Although changed from the dense Dumas novel, the story is compelling and well-written.  The overall tone of the film is dark, though enough bits of comic relief are woven in to keep the story from being overly depressing, especially early on.  Even in places where the film is basically consistent with the novel, the writers have made smart choices, for example by showing the action on Elba instead of having it all be retold in conversations (as in the book).<br /><br />The cast is uniformly superb, including on of Richard Harris' last films as the Priest and Jim Caviezal playing yet another Christ-character in Edmond.  Guy Pearce, who was evidently offered Edmond but decided he would rather play the villian, plays Count Mondego with an ever-so-slight bit of guilt, though this does not affect the crowd-pleasing ending of the film.  My favorate performance, however, is J.B. Blanc as smuggler Luigi Vampa.  Blanc shows the kind of raw charisma that you would expect if Will Smith had played the role instead.<br /><br />The DVD has several special features, not of which are spectacular.  The director commentary is above average and will provide you with some interesting additional tidbits about why the film was shot as it was.  Or where it was, for that matter, such as the pieces shot at the Presidential Palace in Malta.  That said, I am still trying to find the airplane that the commentary says is visible during the climactic fight scene.<br /><br />Overall the film is visually interesting and should be seen on as big a screen as you can get; the camera's scope in capturing the harbor at Marsailles or Edmond's voyage to the Island of Monte Cristo is fantastic and will make this worthty of a big screen.  At the same time, the scenes inside the prison are shot in almost all grays and gives a cramped and depressing feel to the life Edmond lives there.  By the time he escapes you may not realize that you essentially have not seen color in 30 minutes.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent film despite the departures from the book.  if you come into the film with an open mind you will enjoy one of the more under-rated films to come out in the last 10 years.
 B000063W1R, A17FLA8HQOFVIG, Linda Linguvic, 6/7, 5.0, 1047772800, Swashbuckling intensity that never lets up, This 2002 film brings the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas to the screen with a swashbuckling intensity that starts at the beginning and never lets up.  It's set in France at the beginning of the 19th Century and tells the tale of a young man, falsely imprisoned because of his friend's betrayal, who escapes and eventually has his revenge.  Of course it's more complicated than that.  There are ups and downs and twists of fate.  There is swordplay and hidden treasures and pirates and secrets unfolded.  And it's all wrapped up in a package that swept me up in the story and held me captive till the end.<p>Jim Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes who has the misfortune to have Fernand Mondego, played by Guy Pearce, as a friend.  When Dantes is betrayed, he is sentenced to an unlimited amount of time in a terrible prison where he lives in solitary confinement and gets whipped once a year.  The years pass, his clothes grow ragged, his hair grows longer and his despondency increases.  Then, one day, another prisoner, Abbe Faria, played by Richard Harris, tunnels his way into Dantes' room.  Abbe Faria is old, but he has hope.  And together they plan their escape.  All they have to do is spend the next eight years digging another tunnel.  In the meantime, Faria teaches his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; to read and write.  He also teaches him to use a sword.  Eventually, as they make their escape, the old man dies, but not before he gives Dantes a map to hidden treasure.<p>The story now takes a different turn because the treasure that is found allows Dantes to become The Count of Monte Cristo, return to his home town and exact revenge on Fernand Mondego, who is now married to Mercedes, played by Dagmara Dominczyk, who was once Dantes' sweetheart. <p>The acting was excellent, the cinematography outstanding and the story wonderful.  And, because I saw it on DVD, the extras made the experience of watching this film even better.  There's a short history of Alexandre Dumas, who was of Caribbean heritage and one of the most prolific authors of his time.  There's a interview with the screenwriter who talked about the difficulty of adapting this classic and explained exactly why he made certain changes in the story. There's a section that shows the actors learning the art of fencing.  And a section that shows how the sets were built.  These extras were like icing on a cake and certainly enhanced the experience of the film.<p>I loved it.  And highly recommend it.  Especially the DVD version.
 B000063W1R, AJFX9A874WWHI, Ryan Yeung, 6/7, 2.0, 1012521600, A very weak adaption of the novel, Sadly to say, this film is a barebone, cheesy adaption of Duma's original epic.  The original novel was excellent, it had taken the Count of Cristo decades to plot and carry out his revenge bit by bit.  It was sweet revenge at its ultimate; his enemies were slowly tourmented in a cat & mouse sort of game.  However in this movie, events fly by so fast that the entire story seems to happen over night.  Most key characters were either deleted or under developed, and large chucks of the main story lines were cutted.  These two reasons had made the Count's revenge very unsatisfying, as such it's my opinion that they had ruined a great story.
 B000063W1R, A141HP4LYPWMSR, Brian E. Erland "Rainbow Sphinx", 3/3, 4.0, 1161820800, We Are All Either Kings Or Pawns In The Game Of Life, The '02 release of `The Count of Monte Cristo' boasts a superb cast and lavish settings in an outstanding retelling of this classic story of romance and revenge.<br /><br />James Caviezel is perfect as the outwardly stately and poised Count. However his appearance is but a mask to disguise the torment of a man imprisoned and beaten for 13 years. His only desire now is for revenge against his once best friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) who betrayed him and stole his love, the enchanting Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk).<br /><br />A classic tale that can be enjoyed again and again!
 B000063W1R, AOVJYIUATQKR5, JediMack, 0/1, 4.0, 1041379200, Good movie, mediocre Action movie., I acquired this movie because my son loves movies with the three things that make a movie great.  1.  swords,  2.  lots of sword fights and 3.  no long boring sections that he has to fast forward through.  He would give this 1 star.  <p>But I loved this movie and have never read the book.  Everything worked for me.  I even found the "long Boring part" in prison to be interesting, thanks to "the priest".<p>So if you don't know it already, get the PRINCESS BRIDE for your son or daughter (because they won't "fast forward" through it) and get THE COUNT for yourself.
 B000063W1R, A3PVJSJT8JZUAC, "jellybean_558", 0/1, 4.0, 1033603200, A good movie to see, I LOVE this movie!!!  I read the book before watching the movie, (which by the way, you have to read the book it's awesome) I was disappointed it didn't keep to the book, but I understand if it did, it would be much longer.  Many "mini-plots" were kept out, and it was simply Dantes' revenge.  I must admit it was a very good movie.  I simply loved the balloon entrance, and I must say, I would love to have a robe like him, which I must also say, was a good choice of costume.  That is all I have to say, except SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
 B000063W1R, A1K5KYE4MNQXG, Halo Jones, 0/1, 4.0, 1032739200, Entertaining and fun..., If you don't want to blow yet another 4 dollars on a really bad movie, rent Count. It's a fun and irreverent retelling of the popular tale, with James Caviezel doing a great job of going from a wide eyed innocent to an 18th century version of a P. Diddy-player with a vendetta. Pearce is also great as the resident villain who struts around like an ever preening peacock(check out his overly curled bangs too-hilarious). This is just a fun movie that understood how to modernize this tale while simultaneously keeping it's more universally appealing elements....
 B000063W1R, A3OI841P5R6FCH, Zagnorch, 0/1, 4.0, 1011830400, Ain't payback a- well, you know..., Wow, it looks like I'm not the ONLY one who managed to grab a sneak preview of this movie! Fortunately, I got to see this flick for free. And I snuck in my own concessions, too! After all, you don't think I'm gonna actually pay the theater twice as much for a box of Milk Duds as I would if I hit the Seven-Eleven across the street, do you? Hell, no! So I just put on that jacket that has those deep inside pockets, and load up on the finger grub! Heck, there's even room for a big-slam soda in there! And let's not forget-- hey wait a minute, I'm gettin' off the track here. Where was I...? Oh, yes, I'm reviewing the new `Count of Monte Cristo' movie. Anyway, here's my two cents...<p>I've always been a big fan of literature and/or movies about people getting back at those who'd done `em wrong. You know, the "revenge is a dish best served cold" and all that (and no, that is NOT a Klingon proverb, despite what some of you Trekkies out there have been led to believe!). And let's face it, what classic tale of vengeance is more notable than `The Count of Monte Cristo'? Well, perhaps that one episode of `MacGyver'. You know, the one where he fashions a smoke bomb out of his tennis shoes and a swatch of cotton from his t-shirt? Remember that one?<p>Whoops, I'm doin' it again. Time to get back to the subject at hand. The movie does diverge significantly from the original novel, which is to be expected. After all, there's no possible way one could fit such a long-running tome into a two-hour space without some liberties being taken! And besides, I find it an enjoyable diversion picking out the differences between the original literature and its film adaptation. For me, looking for the changes is all part of the fun! And there's quite a few diffs here. I won't go into `em, however; you're gonna hafta find out on your own!<p>The movie is somewhat formulaic, borrowing a good deal of the style and look from other swashbuckling adventures of yore. You know, a little Errol Flynn, a dash of `Cyrano DeBergerac'-style wit, and a nice touch of somewhat-sappy and ever-so-slightly risque romance. There's some violence, but none of it is too gratuitous. A couple of guys getting run through with foils and a few others cut down with single-shot flintlock pistols is about the worst of it, and even then very little blood is shown. There's also some wonderful moments of humor, especially during our dear counts' moments of vengeance-wreaking. His last words to de Villefort as he's being hauled off to the clink is a priceless moment, and had the whole theater laughing and cheering. And a few light scenes between him and his pirate buddy/man-servant Jacopo also had nice touches of humor to them. <p>Even though most of the actors aren't all that well-known (except for Richard Harris, fresh off of his `Harry Potter' gig, playing Dantes' cell neighbor / tutor here), most of them- especially the leads, Dantes/Monte Cristo (James Caviezel) and his former friend Mondego (Guy Pearce)- manage to play their parts quite well. You start to feel for Dantes as he endures his thirteen years in the dungeon, and feel the anger as he begins to lay down his blueprints for revenge. And Mondego develops into the kinda jealous, smug, and insufferable cur that one just loves to hate. And as one might expect, our two antagonists square off to the death in the climactic final confrontation! Who will prevail, you ask? Well, you're just gonna have to see for yourself...<p>`Late
 B000063W1R, ADX5JX5LKLC22, Intro Spective, 0/1, 5.0, 1011312000, BREATHTAKING...THEY JUST DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE, Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.  This was simply magnificent in every possible way. The acting, script, cinematography were stunning.  I just want to say something:  Todays moviegoers want mass market drivel.  This is art.  But at the same time it's an exciting, action-packed, plot AND character driven story during which any viewer with a heart and a soul will be on the edge of his or her seat.  JIM CAVAZIEL, if there is justice in this world, will become a HUGE A-list leading man as a result of his BRILLIANT performance. No other actor out there could have played the Count in this movie; he was made for this, his role of a lifetime, and he deserves an OSCAR FOR IT.  Guy Pearce, so sexy and sympathetic in his previous roles, is so believable as a villain in this movie, that one walks out of the theatre despising his fictional self - sorry Guy this just means that you are a GREAT ACTOR - and big things are waiting for him as well - all actors in this movie are extremely talented and are irreplaceable.<br />PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE, ONE AND ALL - ITS OSCAR CALIBER,CLASSIC STUFF**DO NOT BE DISCONCERTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THE STORY - IT'S A NEW, MODERN, ORIGINAL TWIST - IT'S EVEN GOT SOME COMEDY - A MUST - SEE!!!!!AND I'VE SEEN EM ALL........I WILL PAY TO SEE IT AGAIN.  AS ABOVE, AN AUDIENCE FULL OF MANY JADED PROFESSIONAL MOVIE CRITICS GAVE IT A STANDING OVATION AT CLOSING CREDITS...
 B000063W1R, A2R93V4Q29O83N, C. Carpenter, 13/22, 1.0, 1121040000, A butchery of the book, I had just finished reading the book and decided I'd like see how it was adapted to the big screen.  This version was the worst adaptation I've seen of a book made into a movie.  As I watched the film I wondered if the makers of the movie even bothered to read the book.  My girlfriend kept asking me during the film if "that happened in the book?"  At the end of the movie I told her that basically everything in the movie was not how it occurred in the book.  She enjoyed the movie until the end when it was like a "cheesy 80's montage".<br /><br />The book is wonderful.  When I finished reading it, I felt like I had lost a good friend-I wished I could just keep reading it and reading it.  I've never read such an excellent novel.
 B000063W1R, A1PO10SDIYHOMJ, E. Kleine "hiikew", 8/14, 1.0, 1031616000, They didn't  read the novel before they wrote this BOMB!!!, Probably the worst re-telling of a great novel I have ever seen. Only scant resemblence to the Dumas book appears in this movie. the screenplay is contrived and the action uneven at best. It's too bad because the actors do a nice job with their roles. This may be an unfair criticism because I couldn't bear to watch this thing to the end.<p>The version with Gerard Depardieu is no more satisfying or faithful to the original source.<p>For the new generation of moviegoers, try to see the made for TV movie with Richard Chamberlain as Dantes. You'll enjoy Alexandre Dumas much more than Alexandre Dumb...
 B000063W1R, A33N2SW8DMY4ZZ, Dionna L. L. Sanchez "Emphasis On Moms", 3/6, 5.0, 1127952000, Internal Strength encompassed in a "guys" movie, I love Jim Caviezel in this movie and it's become one of my favorites. It's got drama, a love story, and some action so that you and your spouse can both enjoy it together. I would recommend not allowing young children to watch this movie as it can be violent in spots though. The great thing about this movie is the underlying morals it encompasses. Dantes (played by Jim Caviezel) has every right for revenge for being imprisoned unjustly for 13 years.  Dantes learns an internal strength  and you will feel "gripped" as you follow his emotions from sadness, bitterness, anger, shock, and forgiveness as life continues to change for him in varied ways. You will root for Dantes, cry with him,  smile, and feel justified at the ending.
 B000063W1R, A2RWH9TYO412RC, Samuel F. Lytal, 9/16, 1.0, 1198195200, Another example of why books should not be made into movies, If you have read Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo then you know that it is a tale that begins but developing the character of Edmond Dantes.  He is a simple man whose main ambition is to marry the beautiful Mercedes.  He proposes to her and on the night of their engagement he is arrested for treason, betrayed by his best friend.  This is a summation of the first chapter.<br /><br />The second and maybe third chapter relates his time in prison, learning and growing from his relationship with a fellow prisoner.  He also learns from this prisoner the location of a treasure suitable for a dozen kings.  The remaining 90% of the book relates the immensley complicated details of his revenge on those that tore from him the life he held so precious.  It is a tale of intrigue and revenge that takes its time to build and develop.  When you see the traps swinging closed on Dante's enemies you feel a sense of accomplishment with him.<br /><br />Now, on to the movie.  The first full half of the movie relates Dante's betrayal and captivity.  This leaves only an hour to illustrate his revenge.  What is accomplished is a sad imitation of Alexandre Dumas' master work.  This is one of my favorite books, and one of my least favorite movies.  Hollywood's need for adventure movies to be fast paced to match today's lifestyle has ruined this story for many people.  They just don't know it.
 B000063W1R, A3GGH1ZRO1X6AN, JRK "jkunz", 1/3, 5.0, 1013299200, Critics are wrong, Being an extremely picky movie critic myself, I feel obligated to provide my own two cents when I find the critics completely wrong.  I usually heed the warnings of critics, and even though the Count of Monte Cristo received mixed to poor reviews, I went ahead and saw it anyway.  This movie was a friendly reminder that if you listen to the critics all the time, you might just miss out on something.<p>This was a great movie.  The two hours flew by, I didn't find a dull moment, and while the humor was a touch on the corny side, I feel it actually benefited the movie.  I'm not saying I didn't have any problems with the movie (slightly melodramatic lead-in to ending) but I came out happy and fulfilled.  I wasn't the only one, either.  The whole audience seemed to laugh, gasp and cheer together, proving that other people besides myself enjoyed the Count of Monte Cristo as well.<p>See it yourself and make up your own mind.

It said wrong area when I inserted it, But Im told it cant be returned if 'opened' I just took off the cellophane. Why agree to sell and post a DVD to the UK when it was impossible to watch??<br />a big con trick
 B000063W1R, A2YMUM79BAB0TF, pj, 1/3, 1.0, 1315008000, count of Monte cristo, It finally arrived after waiting over a month....it was sent with no protective wrapping of any kind and was damaged...as was the case it arrived in...I was very disatisfied and not pleased...from now on I will only order strictly from amazon.
 B000063W1R, A6XTOZKDV7X94, paark, 1/3, 1.0, 1309996800, Dysfunctional DVD, I ordered a Used-Like New dvd, and the dvd was packaged nicely with a seemingly new and glossed cover. However, after popping it into the dvd player, the movie played till about half of the time and started freezing and showing no picture but sound. I initially thought something was wrong with my dvd player, so I took the dvd to my friends computers, three of them, and the same error showed at the same place in the movie. I was so frustrated because I loved this movie so much that I was so happy to now have an actual dvd copy of it; however, that was a fail.<br />Because it was Used dvd nonetheless, I felt scammed. The sellers must have had checked whether the dvd worked properly or not, but they still sold it--to me. Please check your USED CD/DVDs before reselling it back! In the end, I asked for a refund, and I hope I get it.
 B000063W1R, AZS4LNQFPHPZL, P. Tune, 1/3, 2.0, 1278633600, Deplorable Adaptation, I'm re-reading the Count of Monte Cristo right now for about the 5th time. This 2002 movie adaptation is highly disappointing. I'm convinced that sometimes creative licenses should be revoked when handling such great works of literature. This movie followed the story of Edmond Dantes like the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? follows Homer's Odyssey. The name of the movie could have been changed and I would have been thoroughly entertained by the action, intrigue and plot.<br /><br />Of course, you're turning French classic literature into a 21st century feature-length screenplay, so timelines are squeezed, characters are omitted or combined, and themes are condensed to appeal to a passive, movie-going audience. The fact that the one treasure chest in the book being translated to dozens of chests in the movie attests to the culture and economy differences between 19th-century Europe and 21st- America. I can't imagine Dumas' original to be handled comprehensively with anything shorter than a mini-series. But this movie told a completely different story with the same names and places. Not only were dozens of dramatic and plot-filled scenes removed, too many scenes were fabricated. I say again, if the movie's name was changed and was admitted that it was only loosely based on the novel, then I would probably vote it up.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone to pick up a copy of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449264">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>. It would only improve your library. I originally read it as required reading my Junior year of high school. Scholastically, books like this broaden your literary horizon, build vocabulary, and give insight to the culture and time-period of the author. Perhaps the 2002 movie (or other screen adaptations) has piqued your interest in the book, and I say emphatically, you won't be sorry you've read it. It really is one of those books that is hard to set down.
 B000063W1R, A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z, Octavius, 12/21, 1.0, 1090972800, The Count of Hollywood, Calling this movie after Alexandre Dumas' original novel is like calling Bernstein's 'West Side Story' 'Romeo and Julliette' after Shakespeare's work. So many elements of the story were altered that Dumas' original plot and theme are no longer recognizable except for the names of some of the characters. They might as well call this film 'The Count of Hollywood' and set the story in modern L.A. instead of 19th century France.<br /><br />  In this film, Dantes is informed of the mission to rescue Napoleon from the onset as opposed to finding about it when returning to shore. Danglars is barely in the picture and is cast as a pirate instead of a banker. Mercedes marries Fernand one month after Dantes is imprisoned instead of 18 months (So much for her loyalty: why would Dantes even forgive her in the end if she were such a tramp?) Luigi Vampa is depicted as the captain who brings Dantes to the island of Monte Cristo right after his escape instead of being a murdering Italian kidnapper he meets much much later. Dante's Turkish guards are ommitted from the story: there's no Princess Haydee or Ali. There's also no Caderousse. In short, this movie has really little if anything to do with Alexandre Dumas' classic 'Le Comte de Monte Cristo. If that's the story you want to see on film, don't see this film.<br /><br />  I strongly recommend the French 1998 mini-series instead of this farce: although Gerard DePardieu's dinstinctive physique undermines his role as a master of disguise, his performance of the role is otherwise excellent. The mini-series is much more faithful to the characters, plots, and themes Dumas sought to convey in his literary masterpiece.
 B000063W1R, A2NHDJD281DRHM, J. Stafiej, 4/8, 1.0, 1332547200, Hopefully you will get a good disc, This review is not of the movie, which I love and why I want it on bluray, the review is of the actual bluray disc.  I bought the movie and exchanged it twice all for the same problems: on my Sony bluray player after the Touchtone splash screen it would shut down the player.  On my PS3 it played fine but only has 2.1 PCM 48Hz audio, no Dolby 5.1 HD.  My player and PS3 have recent updates.  Hopefully you will get a good disc to enjoy the movie to its fullest.
 B000063W1R, A205217DOX0SCR, R. Johnson, 4/8, 4.0, 1129248000, Good..But please don't call it "Faithful", I agree with most revievers who thought this was a very good movie...visually stunning, well acted, etc.  What I take exception to are the comments to the effect that it is faithful to the book.  Having just finished the book myself, I was interested to see the movie.  The departures  from the original story appeared immediately and continued throughout the movie up to and including the ending.  Some were no doubt taken to condense the story to a managable length.  Some were apparently intended to add more action (and a little sex) to appeal to today's audiences who are accoustomed to this (we must be sensitive to those who lose intrest if there hasn't been sex or violence in the last 5 munutes after all).  I'm not saying that the changes where wrong, and they may even have made this a better movie (I actually prefered this ending to the one in the book for instance).  But, PLEASE DON'T CALL IT FAITHFUL to the book.
 B000063W1R, A3PU5P5DWN5OOZ, Jose Rodriguez, 4/8, 1.0, 1041638400, Great Book by Dumas, horrible movie., I can't belive they dis such a horrible work on this movie, if they would have stuck to the plot that went on in THE BOOK, you know, where they got the idea from, then the movie would have been a success.  But since hollywood likes to ruin great works of art, then they do what they did with this movie, they BLEW IT!!!! If you really want to get the true feel of The Count Of Monte Cristo,  then READ THE BOOK, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED THERE.
 B000063W1R, A898P4CKWFLTT, "murdochian", 4/8, 2.0, 1039305600, A good effort, but ultimately cheesy and unlike the novel, To those of you who have recently read The Count of Monte Cristo, I would advise against this film. The story in the movie is so completely different than what Dumas writes - perhaps revenge is the only common denominator. Examples:<p>A) In the novel, Fernand is Edmond's enemy from the beginning - they are never pals. In this movie, the two are very close friends, so it's more dramatic that Fernand betrays Edmond.<p>B) In the novel, Mercedes waits several years after Edmond's "death" before marrying Fernand. In the movie, she marries Fernand right away, and we learn later, it's because she is pregnant with Edmond's child, Albert (who is actually Fernand's child in the novel). This was a very disturbing alteration to me...a little too Hollywood.<p>C) In the film, Mercedes and Edmond get back together and live happily ever after. Cheesy?! In the novel, after so many years and different events, Mercedes and Edmond realize (realistically, I think) that they do not belong together because they have grown in different ways, and Edmond starts a life with his servant (who is a better match for him).<p>D) In the film, everything has to do with sword fights! I thought people used guns in the 1800's??? Anyway, a very liberal interpretation of the text.<p>E) Edmond's revenge against Villefort and Danglars is not even remotely similar to what it is in the novel.<p>All in all, this movie is a sad disappointment to me. It should not say "Alexandre Dumas" anywhere on the screen at any point in time, because his story has been butchered.
 B000063W1R, AIDZDBQXIB0SE, James Jonas, 4/8, 1.0, 1033171200, did they even read the book?, Apparently someone who read the book 5 years ago gave the screenwriter a brief rundown on the plot. Holy [cow]. I really enjoyed the book and this was a big letdown.  Huge parts of movie are new, and enormous pieces of the original plot are left out.  It would be one thing if the changes made the transition to film easier, (as with Lord of the Rings), but I don't think they even tried. Dumas is not exactly the most daring or controversial writer; I'm not sure why a perfectly good story, and ending, had to be filled up with enough dairy to rival a cheese castle. If you haven't read the book in a while or at all and you do like this movie, or even if you think it was allright, please take the time to read or review the book. Maybe the makers didn't want to spoil the book for that haven't read it, I'm not sure.  There's much more satisfaction at the end than an illegitimate child and a duel between two people that were never "boyhood friends."
 B000063W1R, A15S44J4NHU4LS, Alvin Tanhehco "kerki", 4/8, 5.0, 1014854400, Revenge can kill you, yet it's what kept him alive..., I was partway through the rantings of another reviewer about how much this movie strayed from a classic.  And how bad this adaptation was.  But you know what?  I don't really care.  I haven't read the book, and I likely won't.  I happen to like the film.  It has a decent plot, good actors and a theme someone simple-minded as myself can understand - "revenge".  How often have we felt cheated in our lives?  How often have we felt that we are the underdogs?  This film shows us that good things will come to those who wait.  That revenge is sweetest when it is well thought out and exacted with a fury.<p>In this story a sailer by the name of Edmond Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned when his best friend Fernand betrays  him in order to steal his wife.  In prison, Edmond is about to lose hope when a fellow inmate teaches him how to read/write/fight and escape from prison.  At his dying breath, he tells Edmond of a buried treasure that he should use to do good.  Edmond, however, has other thoughts in his mind.  Edmond transforms himself into the mysterious and wealthy Count of Monte Cristo.  With systematic planning, he cleverly inserts himself into high society and exacts revenge from his enemies of the past.  His goal is not to kill them, but to humiliate them and let them know what it feels like to have nothing left to live for.<p>...  The movie was fun to watch, so watch it.
 B000063W1R, A21ZR0P46CLQTE, Dima, 7/13, 1.0, 1072051200, a true product of Hollywood, As I write this, I am about 500 pages into reading the book.  I decided to watch this because I was certain that, as a major Hollywood production, it would not reveal to me any of the plot I have not yet encountered.  Man, I hate being right sometimes.<p>Scene 1:  Edmond, his friend Fernand (!?!?!), who is the son of a count (!?!?!), and the yet-living captain of the Pharaon (!?!?!) are coming ashore on Elba, where they are promptly attacked by English soldiers who run the island (!?!?!).<p>HOLY CRAP!!!  Are you kidding me?  Can the first scence of a supposed movie adaptation of a book have that many grave errors?  Even with my yet incomplete knowledge of the story, I lost count of the inaccuracies when they got into the hundreds.  All the characters are oversimplified into completely good or completely evil (instead of simply human).  Fernand is a malevolent genius.  Danglars hardly enters the picture; and when he does, he is portrayed as a pirate instead of a banker.  Mercedes marrying Fernand A MONTH after Edmond is taken away (instead of 18 months) completely destroys her character.  Luigi Vampa is brought in as the captain of the smuggling ship Edmond encounters just after his escape (when he should be 13 years old).  Names, numbers, and locations are changed seemingly at random.  You might say that a lot of that is not central to the plot.  THEN WHY CHANGE IT?????  No Haydee.  No Ali.  No Caderousse.  No intrigue.  No subtlety.  None of the engaging (and critical) subplots.  None of the political and cultural context.  Overall, this is about the equivalent of digging up M. Dumas and violating him with a Ford truck.  A big loud dirty American Ford truck.<p>Of course, if you have not read the book, you may enjoy this movie a lot more.  But from where I sit, -12 stars seems like a totally appropriate rating for this abomination.
 B000063W1R, A303AOOHDU1VZ2, Stephen Smith, 7/13, 1.0, 1033257600, Dumbed-down and gloomy, Very inferior to the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version. It's as if a chimp took a sledgehammer to the story and knocked all the sense out of it. The characters are dumbed down and the actors are forced into flat caricatures (except for a fine performance by Richard Harris). Caviezal is unable to transform the guileless young Dantes into the dynamic Machiavellian. When he makes his entrance as The Count of Monte Cristo, he limply floats onto the scene and sighs, "Glad you could all make it to my party." Since most of the movie was shot in the dark, there is little for the eyes here. Even the music disappoints.
 B000063W1R, A2MMIZ653FBNPT, Ian Creamer, 10/18, 2.0, 1018828800, Not A Great Re-Make!, This story is based on the classic Alexander Dumas book. The story is about friendship, jealousy, betrayal and then the best part the ultimate revenge and then love rediscovered. I believe this book has been adapted to the silver screen several times but I have only seen the version where Richard Chamberlain plays the count and despite Chamberlain's obvious acting limitations I much preferred that version to this updated one. The main reason for this is that the way the revenge comes together in that movie seemed to be more cunning, complicated and satisfying. <p> The story is based around two friends who have sailed the world together. One grows jealous of the other as even though he(Guy Pearce)is a member of the aristocracy; the other (Jim Caviezel) is more popular respected and also has a love-life. The Pearce character plots a dastardly plan removing Caviezel from France and sending away to a life term in prison where he may just as well be dead. The prison scenes are quite awful with some pretty dire dialogue and lines coming from the prison warden and are only made interesting by the brief appearance of fellow prisoner Richard Harris. Harris tells Caviezel of the vast riches to be found on the Italian island of Monte Cristo. Caviezel who was quite a loving character has now understandably changed and is obsessed with getting revenge on the three characters who placed him in this predicament. This aspect of the film I found very dissappointing-in fact some of the scenes are very poorly done. The counts reappearance to public life is way over the top and looks more like a scene from Moulin Rouge. The revenge on the attorney which takes place in a steam room is utterly absurd. By the time he reveals himself I found I really didn't care less anymore and was quite looking forward to the closing credits!<p> I had anticipated having scene the trailer that this would be a lavish period drama with no expense spared. This movie at times is quite the opposite-the scene set in Rome is a terrible recreation and in facts looks like just a small studio setting. The scenes set in Marseille and the final scene could also be described as being pretty lame. Still though the fact that this is such a marvellous story saves the movie and would make it worth watching if you are unfamiliar with this classic novel.
 B000063W1R, A2DRCJ1YOFTZKK, Dana, 13/23, 2.0, 1020038400, They've trashed yet another masterpiece, Will Hollywood never learn to stop making movies after Dumas' books? After several failed attempts at the musketeers ("The Musketeer", "The Three Musketeers" - with Charlie Sheen et al, "The Man In The Iron mask" with Leonardo Di Caprio and who knows how many more I have fortunately missed), they try their hand at "The Count of Monte Cristo", another wonderful book by Mr. Dumas. Unfortunately, nothing is the same as in the book except for the name and the general plot. If these people don't have enough faith in Dumas and his literary talent to respect  his stories and his characters and put them to the big screen the same way he has written them, why do they bother using them? <p>For somebody who has never read the book - and I think last night in the theater that was unfortunately true for more than half of the viewers - this might come off as a good adventure movie. The settings are great, the costumes are great, it has plenty of action and romance. And the two principals - Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce - are two good actors in their own right, I have enjoyed them in several movies. Jim Caviezel is particularly striking in his appearance and I think he would have been able to give his character the depth and mystery that Dumas' Dantes has, if he had been given the chance. But he was not.<p>Hollywood takes a wonderful and deep story of a man's betrayal, revenge and quest for justice and turns into just another action flick. The characters have almost nothing in common with their book counterparts. Dumas' Dantes was a troubled and mysterious man who was using only his machiavellic intelligence and subtlety to defeat his enemies. This Dantes engages in sword fights and even fist fights, for Pete's sake. He also makes his grand entrance to his parties in a balloon, like he was Michael Jackson or something! Dumas' Mercedes was a proud and poor girl of Spanish ancestry, strong and noble. This Mercedes is just a weak girl, a commerciant's daughter who comes along as easy and a little silly. Dumas' Mondego was Mercedes' cousin, poor like her and with hidden ambitions, capable of subtle betrayal (like he betrayed Haydee's father, for those who have read the book). This Mondego is a son's count and just a petty man. <p>They change characters' names and actions. I will not reveal the most exaggerated one of all, but I will only say it almost topped D'Artagnan turning out to be the king's father in "The Man With The Iron Mask". Also, they changed the ending of the romantic part - but this seems to be a problem with all adaptations of this novel, nobody seems to accept that Dumas didn't want Dantes to end up with Mercedes.<p>They leave out more than 70% of the characters - if not for the other problems, perhaps I would have been able to forgive this one, since it would have been hard to fit in the complexity of the novel in just over 2 hours or so. They add several face-to-face combats which serve no purpose other than satisfying the modern taste for such things. They make Jacopo the comic relief of the movie, uttering silly sentences fit for a B-rate comedy. I could go on forever.<p>And Dantes' great revenge upon his enemies, which took years of careful planning, is solved with rashness in 45 or so minutes, less than half the movie, skipping over everything, never being given the importance it has in the novel, to make room for the romantic part and the sword/fist fights.<p>This is definitely the last Dumas adaptation I'm ever going to watch. Although it is clearly better than any of the Musketeer movies, it is still a disgrace.
 B000063W1R, A1XFGXKWNL752X, Richard S. Heckart, 2/5, 2.0, 1180396800, Good movie but,, This is a very good movie but, the only thing it has in common with the book is the movie has some of the characters.  There, that's it.  The movie could have been named anything but, not "The Count of Monte Cristo."  If you really want the whole story, read the book.  It's a great book.  A good movie but, it has nothing to do with the book.
 B000063W1R, A2NNTNC715AJ50, J. K. Moser "JKM", 2/5, 5.0, 1123459200, A fine adaption of the Dumas classic, Over the past several years the works of Alexander Dumas have been continually butchered on the big screen.  Disney's The Three Musketeers was more interested in laughs than in the story, 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask was just a little off and modern to be Dumas, and it would be better to ignore the ignoble film The Musketeer.  Kevin Reynolds' The Count of Monte Cristo perfectly captured the spirit of the Dumas classic.  Jim Caviezal makes a perfect Edmund Dantes while Guy Pearce is the perfect foil as the monster Count Fernand Mondego.  The acting is superb the story of revenge and redemption is excellent and although dark at times, Reynolds keeps the film moving and captures the elaborate Dantes revenge perfectly.  I give this film high marks and it honors the spirit of the Dumas novel perfectly.
 B000063W1R, A1VNKHD87ZGMQE, S. T. Page "Tinker", 2/5, 5.0, 1108857600, Its not like the book, I found the movie to be compelling interesting and totally unlike any other movie ive seen, that is the reason I read the book, I didnt like the book I found it to be very very dry, its stupid to say that you dont like the movie, what did you expect. If your a fan of a book its your job not to like the movie, Thats why I anticipate that both Ender's Game and the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy are both going to be terrible. Moral to the story Anticipate the worse that way you wont be disapointed.
 B000063W1R, A3JJA7N685ASZG, Nic "past reviews of some pastimes", 2/5, 5.0, 1102291200, Love this Film, I thought Jim Caviezel was an exceptionally great Count of Mounte Christo. He really comes through in the three arcs of Edmond Dantes, his performance is right on as the wronged and then vengeful yet tormented mysterious stranger who takes high society Paris by storm. I am not sure, going by the Director's commentary, if he was a perfect mesh personality wise to the Director's natural rhythmes ( who has made a steller film in this work) & i am not sure if the Director was totally happy with his lead's way with the character or at least found it a bit baffling at times, but i think it was a great combination and is part of what lift's this film into a longterm charismatic classic.<br /><br />The other leads and support roles are all just as good, which with interesting sub-plots here and there, never lets go of one's interest in this great unfolding & rather special drama adaption.<br /><br />The story itself has some pay offs & set-ups that are not as full as they could have been, yet this doesn't take from the film one iota because it has so much else that gives it great depth, from performances, production values and direction, & the right kind of humor balance to splendid emotive beats through out the film.<br /><br />Great sets, writing, photography, sense of 18th century adventure, plot and intense acting all help draw u in to the drama of romance, skull duggary and revenge. So the film has all the elements woven together in a way which is highly enjoyable, while also containing it's own unique special spark.
 B000063W1R, A1ERZIZ48CBCSB, Charismatic Creature, 2/5, 2.0, 1068336000, Weak retelling of classic story, I wanted to like this, I really did. There is a great cast, beautiful cinematography, costumes, swordfights etc...all the elements are there but it doesn't jell. I haven't read the original Dumas novel, but I have seen a couple of the previous versions of this story, so I know that not only are some critical plot elements sadly lacking, but the main theme of the novel -- that revenge is ultimately WRONG, however delicious -- has been butchered.<p>I honestly realize that films need to be heavily adapted and compressed from their novel origins in order to make sense and not run for 100 hours. But the intent and purpose of the original author should be at least honored, if not literally followed word for word.<p>The most serious flaw (besides messing up the whole revenge thing) is that this is a tale played out over the lifetimes of the characters...it has to be, to make dramatic sense. By &quot;hurrying&quot; it up, and refusing to age the very attractive, young cast members (James Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Dagmara Domincyzk, etc.) the sense of the story happening over a lifetime is utterly lost. Even the styles of the costumes do not change, although more than 16 years have elapsed. Edmund Dantes &quot;disguises&quot; himself as the Count of Monte Cristo merely by growing a beard! and his hair isn't even slightly gray athough he is in his mid-40s or later. Mercedes never passes a day over 25...get me her moisturizer, PLEASE.<p>Because so little is at state emotionally, there is no payoff at the end and since the theme has been butchered, Edmund learns nothing about revenge OR mercy, making his lengthy odyssey meaningless.<p>What's good? Again, gorgeous location filming and sets. Some good cameos in smaller parts (Michael Wincott is wonderful as the warden of Chateau D'If, with all the most amusing lines but as the character is utterly invented for this version of the story, you can't help but think that he has wandered over from another, better movie somewhere.) The DVD is total eye candy, with beautiful graphics and some great extra features.<p>This is the ultimate proof, I think, that a good movie is 9/10th a good script. The DVD interview with conceited &amp; self-important screenwriter Jay Wolpert is evidence enough where this project went awry -- Mr. Wolpert clearly thinks he has it all over Dumas and is pleased as punch with how he has altered the classic story to his own way of thinking. NOT.<p>In conclusion...a forgettable disapointment.
 B000063W1R, A1N8K1X0OLLADY, Tim, 2/5, 5.0, 1058054400, At last...a romantic movie without the dirty smut, You don't have to cover your kids eyes while watching this movie. And in these times, that is very rare. <p>The story for this movie is very good. It has a lot of character developement. You watch the star go from a poor, uneducated peasant to a wealthy count, and he uses his wealth to get revenge on those who got him imprisoned in jail for the past 11 years.<p>If you liked Frequency, or The Time Machine (same actors), then you'll enjoy this movie.
 B000063W1R, A3UBWCLVJ6WN2V, "saintbsm", 2/5, 4.0, 1035504000, Good Adaption Of Revenge Classic, Certainly one of the best books ever 'The Count Of Monte Cristo' is  a fairly faithful adaption of the classic novel.<br />Recounting the story of Edmond Dantes (Played fairly good by Jim Caviezel) who is falsely charged of treason then sent off to an island prison where he resides for years before one day a priest (The late Richard Harris in one of his last screen roles) digging a tunnel, breaks through the floor of Edmond's cell.<br />For a few years thereafter the priest teaches Edmond everything he knows until one day the priest dies and Edmond switches places with him so he can escape off the island.<br />Edmond meets up with a gang of pirates and finds the lost treasure of Monte Cristo, thus becoming the richest man alive.<br />He gains esteem and bends his power and wealth to avenge himself from the false charges filed by his best friend (Guy Pearce, displaying the same emotion he did in his 'The Time Machine', released this year) and a shipmate.<br />There are some truly good extras to top off this swashbuckling epic. While nothing extradinary, 'The Count Of Monte Cristo' never fails to entertain and is well worth your time and money.
 B000063W1R, AYG1U47VFZ165, Edward Lee "Trekscribbler (NCC1205)", 2/5, 4.0, 1014940800, Old-Fashioned Movie Fun!, This adaptation of Alexander Dumas's THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO plays out more like a big budget A&E 'movie of the week' than it does a major motion picture of swashbuckling adventure.<p>However, there's a rousing and sweet joy in watching Edmund Dantes (played with infrequent success at achieving one accent by Jim Caviezel) carry out his plot to seek vengeance on those who stole his life away.  Unjustly accused of treason, Dantes endures 16 years of solitude, most in prison, where he manages to meet a fellow prisoner (Richard Harris) and, together, they embark on an attempt to achieve their great escape.  Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, MEMENTO) is put to wonderful use as the villain, and he proves he can chew scenery with the best of them.<p>Perhaps the only disappointment the film has is the lack of swordplay.  In an interview, Caviezel stated that he took fencing lessons for six weeks (even learning how to fence with both hands simultaneously), but there's little swash to this buckle on the silver screen; in fact, Caviezel only picks up a foil three times.  The climax duel between the rivals is far too short for my tastes; instead, I found myself enjoying the ride more than the destination.
 B000063W1R, A1VP82VQ411AHH, mtllcARMS, 2/5, 4.0, 1013385600, The Count gets my vote for outstanding Picture of the Year!, I remember a week before "The Count Of Monte Cristo" actually appeared in theatres, there was an enormous roar from people about this movie going to be amazing, and wonderful, and just about everything good you can think of.  I was under the impression that this movie was going to be basically like the book, and like the earlier version on film.  I was knocked off my feet, because I am still in a state of amazement.  Kevin Reynolds (director) has outdone himself.  The setting for this movie couldn't have been better.  The building up the story line was impressive.  Throught the first half of the movie I couldn't wait for him to seek his revenge on his ex-best friend. I suppose that my biggest suprise was the performance of James Caviezel (The Count).  I don't really want to ruin the movie for anyone, but I have to say that I was a bit dissapointed.<p>  Throughout the entire movie, the whole theme is REVENGE.  And everyone is being built up towards the final fight scene, which is expected to occur.  And really, there wasn't anything outstanding.  I felt that it was over too quickly.  The mark of a Great Film, is one that leaves you in a state of aw.  This movie could have done this for me, but what I was waiting for, came and went really fast.  Otherwise, this movie is a 5 star movie.  Go and watch it, but don't expect a wonderful ending.  There may be a happy ending, but there isn't alot of lasting meaning.

What one does with money is only a reflection of what's in your heart.  Your true heart came out at the end.  Money is a tool.  Venenge is man's spirtual currency.  Restoration is God's.  In the end, God always wins.  Choose your side wisely.

Debonopaula "Longhorn", 5/10, 2.0, 1152489600, Good cast and scenery don't make up for a story so far removed from Mr Dumas' incredible book, The cast was good as was the the movie in general were it not for the fact that the story was so different from the actual book.  It was a real dissappointment to say the least.
 B000063W1R, A3KZWXHLEMAZID, J. Evans "Cobra Kai Dojo", 5/10, 1.0, 1107043200, This is what happens when you cram a classic into a matinee, After finishing Dumas' classic novel, I immediatly watched this movie. About an hour later, and a hillarious balloon scene, I sadly ejected the DVD, which I now use for a coaster. If you've never read the book, you've got nothing to lose. But if you've ever read the book, you get that sense of annoyance very quickly, and outrage towards the end. Do yourself a favor and read the book first! It is excellent!
 B000063W1R, AJUDAZVU7UMJC, whea-wix, 3/7, 5.0, 1036627200, This Counts as a Classic, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best movies of this type (classic literature for the MTV age).  I love it, and I teach high school English.  While it is true that the movie sometimes strays far from the book, it still holds the same ideals of revenge, forgiveness, and faith.  Fabulous!
 B000063W1R, A1G4B9IY8WU9ES, Ms. Rich "AM LIT TEACHER", 0/2, 5.0, 1327708800, Classic Score!, This is such a marvelous rendition of Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo" that even my beloved, but red-necked, son-in-law liked it.  Full of swash and buckle, intrigue and suspense, this movie even has tender love scenes thrown in for the ladies.  Good guys win, bad guys pay, and the lady gets her man. The period piece costuming is well done.  All of the fight scenes are believable with no acrobatics spoiling the credibility.  And when it comes time for the bad guy to get what is coming to him, you are cheering.  It is entertaining while cleverly promoting morals such as education is a virtue, all things come to he who waits, and best of all - vengeance is a dish best served cold!

 B000063W1R, AZC67HZXX5EQ1, Michael Malloy, 0/2, 5.0, 1325376000, a great movie, This is a great story of the Count of Monte Christo and how he became the count via the betrayal of a close friend and the tutoring of 'the prist' in prison.  Very inspiring movie I would recommend without any reservation.

 B000063W1R, A3JLOIXFM75QNV, Val "LOTRMatrixHPLostFreak", 0/2, 2.0, 1190332800, Somewhat boring, I've never read the book so I cant compare, but I do remember that the film itself was quite boring at times and just too long, or at least it felt long. Normally I love movies like this, but this just didn't do it for me. The acting was OK, nothing special stuck out out for me. The set pieces and costumes were very well done however, which I think is essential in a movie such as this. Other than that, I would skip it.

Gellenbeck "Austin Movie Watcher", 0/2, 5.0, 1126656000, An entertaining time in revolutionary France., The Count of Monte Cristo is an entertaining film that we saw in the theater and then bought for home viewing.  We like it so much that, when we couldn't locate the VHS tape that we purchased, we bought a DVD copy to replace it.  We enjoy watching it again and again.
 B000063W1R, A12PNLQL3E6W4C, Mr. Caraballo, 0/2, 5.0, 1120608000, This movie rocks!!, James Caviezel and Guy Pearce bring "The Count of Monte Cristo" book to life! This movie is great from beginning to end. I'd been meaning to see it for 3 years now and finally had the chance to watch it last night. The acting, the cinematography, the script, the beautiful Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), make this movie a top 100 on mine and any other movies fan's list! I could not take my eyes off the screen. I kept wanting to see more and more as i didn't know what would happen next. I guess never having read the book has its advantages lol!!
 B000063W1R, A3UJJGY799F76I, I ain't no porn writer, 0/2, 5.0, 1083628800, intriguing classic tale of betrayal, injustice, and revenge, A man named Dantes is about to be married to the woman he loves. Only one problem: his best friend loves her too. Solution? Evil best friend gets Dantes put away in a prison fortress for a long time off on some remote and desolate island. A Verrrry long indefinate sentence. Dantes miraculously eventually escapes after 13 years to find--yup, you guessed it--his beloved is married to best friend. Understandably, Dantes is enraged and is out for blood. This is a classic and intricately plotted tale, brilliantly re-created in this film. The sword fight sequence near the end is so spectacular and realistic too!<p>David Rehak<br />author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;

 B000063W1R, ANE9HHP1P8LEP, Emily Sieger, 0/2, 5.0, 1066694400, Lovely, This is an excellent movie.  Even though it is &quot;a typical Holly Wood production&quot;, it didn't mutilate the plot so much you couldn't even recognize the title of it.  Edmond Dantes is protrayed perfectly but Mercedes' actress doesn't look like the real Mercedes.  The film shows every thing that gets the theme of the book across, and the changes made fall into place.  Even though I had my hands clutched in terror during parts of it,  I still laughed and cried.  It was a wonderful movie and the ending is so sweet.  Even though the book's ending was sweet, this one has the 'happily ever after' part added to it. And all the subplots were eliminated, so were many characters so it is much easier to follow.  And even though the film goes by so fast, the actions of the characters results in a lot of development.
 B000063W1R, AGKMDWGVABVH, "jrparente", 1/4, 5.0, 1086912000, Absolutely Stellar.., I love this Movie!  Totally Addicted to it!  It actually has a plot that keeps you glued to the screen without machine guns or 5800 unnecessary boob shots! LOL<br />I watch it at least twice a month.<br />This is the way movies should be instead of that junk in the theaters.<br />Jayce
 B000063W1R, A27RJ30RN5K9MX, Mitch Weaver, 1/4, 5.0, 1070409600, This movie was amazing, Edmond Dantes(Jim Caviezel) and his best friend Fernand ( Guy Pierce) are forced to dock ship to save the life of their captain. Napolean will only offer medical assistance if Edmond delivers a letter from Napolean to Versaille. Little does Edmond know that it contains plans to overthrow the king. When Edmond and Fernand return, Edmond is promoted to captain of the ship and becomes engaged to his one true love Mercedes (Dagmara Domincyzk). Fernand becomes jealous of Edmond's life and he also feels betrayed when he manages to find out about the letter. He turns Edmond into the authorities. Now Edmond is branded a traitor to France and sentenced to life imprisonment in the worst prison imaginable. Mercedes is told by the crown prosecutor that Edmond is dead, and she marries Fernand. While inside, Edmond befriends a priest ( Richard Harris) who educates him, teaches him to fight, and lets him know of a treasure of the Island of Monte Cristo. Edmond promises his friend that he will escape and find the treasure. Edmond finally does after 14 years and uses the treasure to become the Count of Monte Cristo. As the count, Edmond plans to gain revenge on Fernand and the Crown Prosecutor (James Frain), as well as win back Mercedes.<p>Count of Monte Cristo has an amazing story of revenge and love, outstanding acting, and thrilling swashbuckling action that will keep you glued to the screen. Jim Caviezel nails the role of Edmond Dantes to perfection. Guy Pierce does an amazing job as Fernand. His treacherous ways make him the perfect villan. Dagmara Domincyzk does a nice job as Mercedes. I also enjoyed James Frain's performance as the Crown Prosecutor. The best performance has to be by Richard Harris. Harris's portrayal of the priest is excellent. The story itself will keep you glued to the screen from beginning to end and the fighting sequences are top notch. The only problem I had with the film, is that the adaptation did not really follow the book at all. However, the film still manages to be enjoyable, and in some instances, it is even better than the book.<p>The supberb acting, thrilling action sequences, and overall story are responsible for making Count of Monte Cristo one of my all time favorite films. The DVD offers outstanding picture and sound quality, as well as some nice special features as well. This is definately a film that I consider a must own.
 B000063W1R, ASIDGLECI96TG, "spikki", 1/4, 5.0, 1013472000, The film that has everything, I went to this movie because of two reasons:  To see Guy Pearce, and because I love this particular Dumas story.  I was immensely rewarded.  It was a faithful retelling, and it was filmed in an extremely entertaining way.  The action sequences were believable and nail-biting, and the performances of Guy Pearce, Jim Caveziel and Richard Harris were terrific.  This is the way movies used to be made.
 B000063W1R, A26DX7HHQ7EM60, Dee, 1/4, 1.0, 1340236800, Don't buy if you live in America, This DVD would not play due to parameters.  Read carefully ...REGION 2.  Will not play in America.

 B000063W1R, A34F4ZL5HE99AT, Spike5, 1/4, 1.0, 1304380800, The actor playing the Count isn't up to the job, The Count of Monte Cristo in the original book starts off as a young and naive sailor. But the betrayal by his supposed friends and his unjust imprisonment turns him into someone very different.  He presents himself at different times as enigmatic, dangerous, cunning, able to bend criminals to his will and to lure aristocrats into becoming his friend.  He finds out the inner secrets of each of his enemies and turns their weaknesses into their downfall.  This character is perhaps the most romantic in fiction and one of the most complex.<br /><br />The script does the actors a serious disservice, but a stronger actor in the role of the Count could still have done a good job of showing us the deep undercurrent of anger that drove his actions and made him believable.  Unfortunately, James Caviezel isn't capable of bringing that depth of acting to the role.  The people who enjoyed the mini-series/film either never read the book or have forgotten what it was really like.
 B000063W1R, A1Q44JC73WF03N, AmyTia, 1/4, 1.0, 1294876800, This DVD SKIPPED FREQUENTLY, I opened this "new" DVD and it skipped every 20 to 30 seconds throughout the entire movie. I would not recommend buying a DVD from this seller, as it may not work properly.
 B000063W1R, A2UAQ4AB1XU623, Lucy Coronado, 1/4, 1.0, 1220486400, Completely misses the point!, The book, The Count of Monte Cristo, is one of my favorites.  I know that movies can miss certain elements in the book and that usually the book is better.  So I can forgive most movies even if they miss some things.  But this movie seems to have missed the point entirely.  It seems that they thought sword fights and one-liners where what this story is about.  Where the book created this fully fleshed world of Edmond Dantes, the movie is like the superficial Hollywood version of the hastily read cliff notes.  If you are looking for a movie that takes the themes from this book accurately, then watch the movie, SLEEPERS.  (with Jason Patrick, Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro, etc.)  Even though the time and place and people are entirely different, the story of this film rings more true to the heart of the novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, than any film version of the book I've ever seen.  Read the book, and watch both movies and you'll see why.
 B000063W1R, A32AK8FOAZEPE2, JustAReader "NoNeed2Comment", 1/4, 3.0, 1144195200, a wrong casting job, further ruined by a lame screenplay, this is in general a very bland movie with inappropriate castings, further ruined by a lame screenplay. scenes and settings are all okay but all the major roles simply failed to deliver an in-depth viewing feelings. the make-up jobs for all the casts were also terrible. after 15 years (based on the age of dantes' son) gone by, nobody seemed to change a bit, but nobody seemed to recognize nobody, that's ridiculous. the ending also sucks. adapted from this great novel that i've read and re-read three times, this was perhaps the worst one transcribed from the novel. what a waste of great settings and costumes. we simply failed to feel anything emotional during the watch.
 B000063W1R, AIQ2YYD0AU151, BMS "Brian", 8/16, 1.0, 1035849600, The Count of Monte Cristo, For those of you who have read the book (abridged or unabridged), be prepared to be dissapointed!  The only similarity that the movie and the book share is the name itself.  It is a travesty that somebody can re-write a classic literary work into something like a made-for-tv movie!  Check that...there is a made-for-tv series in French (made by Bravo, I believe) that is the closest depiction of The Count of Monte Cristo that I have ever seen.  I would not waste my time watching thismovie!  See the bravo flick...not this one!
 B000063W1R, AVBFGFL4E7JHF, Regina Pounds "novelist", 3/3, 4.0, 1105315200, Visually a treat, Dumas' stories have been filmed so often, yet it still is a joy to see them. This new version of the Count of Monte Christo is no exception. It has serious flaws and errors, too numerous to list. For example: modern language lines, totally unbelievable interpretations (as other reviewers mentioned), very amateurish characterizations (the Count twirls his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture rather than by his nearly unchanged looks). None of these things really disgusted me. I just sat back and enjoyed. The opening scene set a mood and the photography generally showed fine settings. The very end was incredibly sappy, but since I had just watched a wonderful fighting/fencing scene with a lush green setting, I didn't care too much.<br /><br />A strong complaint I have about most new movies: the voices are almost inaudible compared to the background music and noises.<br /><br />I hope you will read the book, if you haven't already. No film ever has done Dumas' story telling power justice. The Three Musketeers film version with Michael York as d'Artagnan came close.<br /><br />If you're willing just to be entertained, this movie may fit your mood. I saw it three times by now.
 B000063W1R, A3QLZ79JF6R1A4, Bigflu, 3/3, 5.0, 1062115200, Never Read the Book ......., I never read the book, so this story was entirely new to me. I loved it. Like all movies, there are a few plot holes but the overall feeling and effect of the film are fantastic.<p>The story centers on a young man wrongfully sent to prison after being betrayed by his best friend for the love of his fiance. The man, long thought dead, spends many years in prison where he meets another inmate. This inmate teaches him to read, write, fight, and gives him the location of a great treasure. The scorned man uses this treasure to regain himself a life and seek out revenge on those responsible for his misery and torture. The plot twists and thickens and keeps you entertained throughout.
 B000063W1R, A2NJO6YE954DBH, Lawrance M. Bernabo, 3/3, 4.0, 1046390400, Some interesting twists on the Alexander Dumas classic, The tendency is to see this 2002 version of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; as redemption for director Kevin Reynolds after the fiasco of &quot;Waterworld,&quot; but this particular retelling of the classic adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas p&egrave;re is mainly the creation of screenwriter Jay Wolpert.  I read the novel--the unabridged version--in the sixth grade despite the insistence of my teacher that I could not possibly do so.  Consequently, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; holds a special place in my mind.  Wolpert's adaptation provides several new twists on the classic tale, but these are not gratuitous liberties.  The idea that Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel) and Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) are now best friends, the creation of the sadistic Armand Dorleac, d'If Warden (Michael Wincott), and the new rationale for the marriage of Merced&egrave;s Iguanada (Dagmara Domincyzk), all work within the framework of the story.  They are not additions as much as much as ways of enhancing the tragedy.  The animosity between Edmond and Fernand is now that of a man betrayed by his jealous &quot;brother.&quot;  Edmond's imprisonment at Chateau d'If takes on added horror as the warden willingly admits it is a place to which only the innocent are sent.  The secret Merced&egrave;s reveals at the end allows the final battle between Edmond and Fernand to be played out against a new dynamic of suddenly revealed relationships.<p>Edmond Dantes has the misfortune of becoming involved in the shifting politics of France in the period between the two reigns of the Emperor Napoleon.  Betrayed by the self-interest of several men, he is imprisoned for life on a desolate rock.  There he has a fortuitous encounter with the Abb&eacute; Faria (Richard Harris), who becomes Edmond's mentor and who reveals the secret of the treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo.  This wealth will provide Dantes with the means to gain vengeance on those who destroyed his life, especially when he learns that insult has been added to injury and that his beloved Merced&egrave;s is now the Count of Morcerf and married to Mondgeo.  "The Count of Monte Cristo" was filmed on location in Malta and Ireland, and the art direction and set design are well suited to the tale being told.  Kevin Reynold's direction provides a brisk pace to the adventure and I especially liked the low angle tracking shots he used during the climatic duel between Edmond and Fernand.  Special mention needs to be made of William Hobbs, who choreographed the swordplay as the "fight arranger," a job he has done on other Dumas films before in his lengthy resume.  <p>This is Wolpert's first movie screenplay.  Previously he worked as a writer on the television series "The Lot," having mostly been a producer of television games shows such as "The Price is Right" and "Match Game."  So it is rather surprising that his adaptation is so strong.  I would not have minded if the film had more of an epic heft to it, but I do understand the Hollywood mentality that depends such films come in under two hours.  Wolpert's dialogue also has some wonderful moments, such as when Dorleac strings up his new prisoner, Edmond, and says: "Now you're thinking, just now `Why me, O God?'  The answer is, God has nothing to do with it.  In fact, God is never in France this time of year."  Later on Jacopo (Luis Guzm&aacute;n), the smuggler turned valet who serves the Count, tells his master "God sees you out of the corner of his eye."  There are several gems like this throughout the film, which balance the more pedestrian lines and the several anachronistic examples of street talk that intrude on the tale.  This version of "The Count of Monte Cristo" is not a great film but it is a very good adventure story, whether you know the original tale or not (unabridged or not).
 B000063W1R, AY99WNAYRUIFC, Paul A. Rundle, 3/3, 5.0, 1045526400, Amazing movie with an exceptional plot and great twists, This movie is a wonderful work of art. It should have won an Oscar! The movie is set in France with lush backgrounds and a truly incredible story based on the book by Alexander Dumas. Not only is it a terrific tale of love and survival, it is also a feast for the adventure fan. The Count of Monte Cristo is filled with enough swordfights, daring escapes, and backstabbing comrades to satisfy any viewer. I highly recommend this movie.
 B000063W1R, A1KBEHXGW71JDO, Thomas Walsh, 4/10, 1.0, 1033171200, If you liked the book...DON'T SEE THIS, What an unmitigated piece of garbage.  Richard Harris is always wonderful but he's the only redeeming feature of this perverse twisting of Dumas' classic.  See the G&eacute;rard Depardieu mini-series instead.  (If you can ignore the fact that he doesn't look starved in the Chateau d'If, it's wonderful.)  Except for Harris the acting is poor.  The people are unrealistic and are, at best, caricatures of Dumas' creations.  The writer has committed a crime.

It's hard to fault the plot, when it's based on a renowned classic like Dumas' The Count Of Monte Cristo, even if it is a simple revenge tale. Unfortunately, none of the acting rises above the page.<p>None of the leading men are quite manly. James Caviezel who plays Edmond Dantes and Guy Pearce, who plays Fernand Mondego both come across a little weak as swashbucklers. Caviezel tends to be a blank slate anyway, but I really liked Pearce in Memento, so I was a little disappointed to see his be such a weak character. You do dislike Fernand Mondego and want to see him meet his demise, but Pearce could have taken it much further and given Caviezel more distance to grow as a character. Richard Harris may have walked through this role, but he delivers the best performance of all the actors.<p>Overall, it's a good Saturday movie if you want to watch some guys sword fight a little bit and not have to think to much.

 B000063W1R, AON6QJ88F2ARM, Susi, 0/3, 5.0, 1318809600, Great Movie, I ordered this dvd, it came in the mail quickly, it is in perfect condition (no scratches). We have watched it 3 times already!
 B000063W1R, A2VLH0R0UP9ULJ, Michael "Physicist", 0/3, 1.0, 1291248000, Generic Hollywood Rubish, This movie is the events of Dumas' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure/love story.  The formula is the same used in 80's montage movies:  1) Weak but good-hearted kid suffers as he hands of evil men.  2) Kid has a montage.  3)  Kid gets revenge.
 B000063W1R, ASUEUK3RMFZHR, Grog, 1/5, 1.0, 1322524800, Second time to return Disk, I had to return this Blue Ray twice and I still don't have a working copy. finaly I told Amazon to refund my purchase. the disc would not play on my new Sony BR player. I updated my firmware and other BR discs played on my player, but I was never able to get this disc to play.
 B000063W1R, A2NK3PX0BLER6M, Dilemma "DLMA", 1/5, 1.0, 1265587200, A VERY abridged and altered Count of Monte Cristo!, Why is it that so many filmmakers believe that they can improve upon classic novels by changing them?  Such conceit rarely results in a movie that is a credit to the novel upon which it is based, few surpass the original, and this is certainly no exception. Jim Caviezel is certainly eye candy in this movie, and if you are interested in that, or in seeing a VERY YOUNG Henry Cavill (of the Tudors), then by all means buy this movie.  However, if you want to enjoy "The Count of Monte Cristo," slog through the book.  This is NO substitute.  Most of the plot has been stripped away, and that which remains has been altered beyond recognition.
 B000063W1R, A2ZYB2S79GU5WL, matthew h, 1/7, 3.0, 1030752000, decent, but not even close, I watched this movie with great anticipation after reading the book however, I quickly realized that this is not the same story that Dumas put on paper all those many years ago.  If you have never read his book it will entertain you.  It was entertaining but again it was not even close to the book.  It would be better titled "Kinda like the Count...Cristo".
 B000063W1R, A2D4RUMDYEF0S5, Thomas Foss, 5/22, 1.0, 1073692800, Utter crap, This is easily one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Forget that, it's one of the *two* worst movies I've ever seen. While Guy Pearce is usually an excellent actor, and Jim Caviezel has the perfect look for Edmund Dantes (at least, post-imprisonment), there is nothing that could have saved such a woefully terrible screenplay. The Dumas novel is one of the best books I've ever read, filled with intrigue, action, and mystery, with vibrant characters and brilliant plotting. Granted, adapting such a grand story to the screen would probably take four hours or more, but if one isn't going to attempt an adaptation of the original story, then one should just make a new movie. That being said, all the interesting, original parts of the book were removed and replaced with a cookie-cutter revenge plot, stereotypical, one-dimensional characters, and bland dialogue that too often inserts modern slang into Napoleonic-era France. This movie is the "Count of Monte Cristo" in name only, and in every other way, a poorly conceived, vapid, dime-a-dozen action flick. Avoid it at all costs.
 B000063W1R, A2AW4A1E87R9UH, H. Mirza "The Dude", 13/50, 1.0, 1030233600, Pan & Scan... Forget it!!!, I've been itching to buy this movie since I saw it in the theatre. Now I'm going to have to wait until they release a widescreen version because there's no way I'm paying for pan&scan.<p>A beautifully crafted film both in visuals and acting, not to mention the masterful story telling. The only letdown is not having widescreen, which is unforgivable and therefore this DVD release gets one star, for what would otherwise be a five star rating.
 B000063W1R, AQ01Q3070LT29, James McDonald, 0/33, 1.0, 1110240000, Luis Guzman is in this one!, My only reason for seeing this film is because  Luis Guzman is in it.  I find these Napoleon/Shakespeare/pirate films to very very dull, boring and over-long.<br /><br />  Luis plays a much different role here than what we are use to seeing.  Doesn't he look handsome in that red English coat?
 B000063W1R, A2YWGP8UUU66SQ, Alexander Borrelli, 3/3, 2.0, 1012176000, a good movie but a horrible adaptation, As a movie the Count of Monte Cristo is entertaining on its own but when compared to the book it is horrible.  There are several instances where Hollywood had its way with the plot.  The revelation about who Alberts real father is being the worst.  This did not happen in the book.  The movie lacks the style of the book.  The Count was much more subtle and devious in the book and never stooped to getting is hands diry himself.  I also don't recall any sword fights in the book (although they were decent, but nothing spectacular).  As I said, taken on its own the movie is entertaining but it deviates terribly from the book which is superior in everyway.
 B000063W1R, A1HBXCEAW5FEBJ, NCD, 5/6, 5.0, 1029715200, AMAZING!!, Ok this MOVIE is  amazing. Im tired of these people crying and saying its not the book. Yea its not the book its a MOVIE! Get it threw ur heads, all books are diff from movies. Its a great movie about love,betrayl,revange,what else do you need. The acting was great. And if your bored go read the book but if you want to watch a great MOVIE watch this epic.
 B000063W1R, A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1, Savant11 "Savant11", 5/6, 5.0, 1011916800, Stupendous!!!!!, This is simply the best film I have seen since May 6,2000 when I sat down to watch Gladiator. It is absolutely amazing and beyond words. I really thought that this movie would be a farce considering the length of the book and the treatment that was done of "The Three Musketeers" back in 1993. But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised at the faithfullness to the text. Yes some things were changed and peripheral characters were left out, however that should be expected since there was no way that the entire contents of a 1091 page book are going to fit into a theatrically realeased movie.<p>The movie is so well done that you don't even care. And trust me I'm a hardcore fan of the COMC, it is one of my top favorite books.<p>The only thing I saw Jim Caviziel in was that Jenifer Lopes flick where he seemed "out of it". For some reason I thought that I would get the same performance in this movie. Not so Caviziel plays Edmond the way I thought that he should be played. First off all as a naive boy, then as the movie progresses you see the anguish he goes through as his innocence has been ripped from him in prison, then to the noble aristocrat with a shimmering rage just underneath the surface. Guy Pearce is excellent as t the perfidious Fernand, and so is James Frain as Villefort. I especially liked Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedes. She and Caviziel had the most amazing chemistry. It was one of the best and most believable romances I have seen on the big screen.<p>The acting, the sets, the costumes and the excellent sword fights truly make this a delight of the senses. I wish that Hollywood would put this kind of stuff out more often. Please see this film believe me you will NOT be disapointed.
 B000063W1R, A2887J6P8VPB5H, Nichomachus, 5/6, 2.0, 1082937600, Unbelievably dull, I love the book, which supposedly means I'm in no condition to enjoy a good movie, much less know a bad one when I see it. Anyway, I put off watching this thing because I figured they would screw it up. But actually, the first third of the movie was pretty good. My hopes rose, foolishly, and then the harsh glare of bad scripting sent them crashing into the sea. The 1975 version is vastly superior, being much more believable and stylish. This 2002 effort isn't exactly awful, mainly it's just boring.<p>The Caviezel fellow did a nice job in the first part of the film, playing the naive sailor/prisoner. The conversion to the Count was never believable, however, always coming off as a bit of a putz. He simply didn't fill the role. The scenes with the Abb? Farria were the most successful. And although the Chateau d'If whipping scenes were gratuitous, and the book never actually portrayed the landing on Elba, I think they enhanced the story. So there!<p>So the betrayal, false imprisonment, suffering, and relationship with the Abb? weren't badly done. Caviezel played the prisoner bit very well, and it seemed a real evolution was going on as the years went by. Thus, the set-up of the main plot was accomplished, but the execution was definitely botched.<p>It all went downhill with the hot air balloon bit. It was stupid. I like Luiz Guzman, but what was he doing in this movie? His absurd portrayal, I guess some see it as "comic relief" was just campy, just plain bad, and the rest of the movie sank like a stone. Caviezel's "Count" was merely foppish and ridiculous. With Caviezel as Count Clown dandy, instead of the dangerous and inscrutable figure of the novel, it all just fell apart. That's not being a stickler to the book, that's just translating the basic character to film.<p>Basically, the writer and director were never able to set up the vengeance(s) very well. The Count's execution of his plots were never really that clear or interesting. The dialogue between him and his prey were badly written, with a few double entendres and little else. The fairy-tale ending they went for was also VERY lame, you don't have to be a fan of the book to roll your eyes at all of the loose ends being methodically tied. And since at least twenty years went by and all the actors were still obviously in their late-twenties, it was a relief when the tedium finally ended.
 B000063W1R, A3I3UF46UWQJFU, "mr_fan87", 7/9, 5.0, 1012089600, Wow!, The Count Of Monte Cristo<p>I went to this movie, expecting to see nothing more than a good adventure movie with decent sword fights. Mind you, I did not know of the story of The Count Of Monte Cristo, however I liked many of Alexander Dumas' other stories. What I received from this movie, was an amazing plot line, great sword fights, over the top performances by the entire cast, and simple humor. I was definitely surprised at how simple the filming techniques were compared to many of Hollywood's other recent films, and this made it only better. Probably the best tale of revenge I have ever experienced, The Count Of Monte Cristo will go down in history as one of my favorite movies. I could not stop smiling the entire time, and man did I really hate Guy Pierce!<p>Final Grade: 10/10 (There was absolutely nothing wrong with this movie!)
 B000063W1R, A2FRKEXDXDN1KI, Dennis A. Amith (kndy), 2/2, 4.0, 1323993600, Blu-ray: The Count of Monte Cristo" is exciting, entertaining and a clever revenge film worth watching!, Back in 1800's, French writer Alexandre Dumas is famously known for writing "The Three Musketeers" but he is also known for writing the literary classic "The Count of Monte Cristo".  The film would receive a TV film adaptation in 1975 starring Richard Chamberlain (and an excellent TV series with Gerard Depardieu from 1999) but it wasn't until 2002 when the novel would receive a film adaptation directed by Kevin Reynolds ("Waterworld", "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves", "Red Dawn") and written by Jay Wolpert ("Pirates of the Caribbean" films).<br /><br />The film was well received by critics and has developed a fan following since its release on DVD.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"The Count of Monte Cristo" is presented in 1080p HD (1:85:1) and having owned the previous DVD release of this film, I have to say that this film looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.  From the lavish outfits to the amount of detail on the costumes, the detail of the prison and overall set and costume design, there is so much detail in the textures.  Black levels were nice and deep and I didn't see any banding or compression artifacts in this release.<br /><br />If anything, if you are a big fan of this film, the Blu-ray release definitely looks a lot better than its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"The Count of Monte Cristo" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital & Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The original DVD release of "The Count of Monte Cristo" was mainly dialogue driven while the Blu-ray release remains the same.  It's a dialogue-driven film and is pretty much center and front-channel driven.<br /><br />There are some moments during the film where you can hear the ambiance such as chains in the prison, the clanging of the swords or the galloping of horses through the surround channels.  But for the most part, it is a dialogue-driven film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Count of Monte Cristo" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary With Director Kevin Reynolds - Featuring in-depth commentary by director Kevin Reynolds talking about the film, the production including some of the challenges faced (as well as glitches) in the film.<br />  The Pen - (6:38) A featurette about Alexandre Dumas, the original writer of the novel "The Count of Monte Cristo".<br />  A Retrospective on author Alexandre Dumas "Adapting A Classic" - (8:50) A featurette about the film adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' novel and the challenges that Jay Wolpert faced.<br />  The Napoleonic World - (8:14) A featurette on the production and costume design of "The Count of Monte Cristo" and locations of where Kevin Reynolds had considered shooting and how Malta was the location that was perfect for the film.<br />  The Clash Of Steel - (10:21) A featurette about the stunt choreography of "The Count of Monte Cristo".<br />  Deleted and Alternate Scenes - (22:16) Featuring a total of five deleted and alternate scenes with intro with Director Kevin Reynolds and the editor, Stephen Semel and commentary featuring the two discussing why certain scenes were cut out.<br />  En Garde: Multi-Angle Dailies - (3:o2) Featuring the dailies of the final sword fight ala two-camera setups with commentary by Kevin Reynolds.<br />  Layer-By-Layer Sound Design - (4:45) An interactive sound design featurette which you can listen to the isolated audio (using your audio button).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"The Count of Monte Cristo" is a revenge film that doesn't fit the banality of modern bloodlust revengeful films.  It's a clever storyline of one man's climb from being an officer turned prisoner who had nothing.  Illiterate, lost all family and his the woman he loves and is meant to rot in prison.<br /><br />What kept him strong is his belief in God, but the longer he stayed in prison, his belief started to fade and eventually, while in prison, is able to educate himself and become a better man which helps lead to his goal for revenge.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and turns in the story of "The Count of Monte Cristo" and as adventurous and exciting the plot line is, especially since it's an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel, director Kevin Reynolds knows that he is not making a true-to-novel adaptation.  There is just no way to capture the setting and overall theme of the novel in a two hour movie.  For those wanting a more faithful adaptation, the 1999 TV series featuring Gerard Depardieu is the most faithful adaptation of the novel yet.<br /><br />But for those who are not willing to engage in reading "The Count of Monte Cristo", Reynolds direction and Wolper's screenplay focuses on the more swashbuckling, adventurous side of "The Count of Monte Cristo".  And since the making of this film, Wolper has not deviated from focusing on the action and adventure as evident in the "Pirates of the Last Caribbean" films that he has written thus far.  The historic events revolving around Napoleon Bonaparte is not important in the overall film, it's the revenge factor and seeing how a man that is sent to rot in prison would eventually find a way to exact justice on those who framed him.<br /><br />It's also important to note that their is also a humorous side to the film.  For one, the casting of Luis Guzman as Jacopo was quite amusing, but for the most part, it worked.  Some acting was a bit off, especially when it comes to James Caviezel's earlier Edmond Dantes but it does get better as the film progresses.  The same can be said  with Dagmara Dominczyk's Mercedes Iguanada and found that I had to switch on the subtitles to understand what she was saying at times.<br /><br />But for the most part, I enjoyed "The Count of Monte Cristo" and the Blu-ray release looks much better and sounds better than its original DVD counterpart and all the special features that were included on the 2002 DVD release is included on this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />The film is pretty much it's own story and really can't be compared to Alexandre Dumas' novel.  In fact, there may be some similarities by name, by location and such but if you are looking for a close adaptation to the novel, this film is not it.  But for those who enjoy Jay Wolpert's style of writing (especially for what he has done for the "Pirates of the Last Caribbean" films), then you probably will enjoy this film.<br /><br />Overall, "The Count of Monte Cristo" is exciting, entertaining and a clever revenge film worth watching!
 B000063W1R, A2AVV9LV9UXT6F, Darren B. O'Connor, 2/2, 5.0, 1260403200, One of my very favorite movies, "The Count of Monte Cristo" is a classic tale of betrayal and revenge (which the novel's author, Alexander Dumas, was inspired to write after reading of an incident, broadly similar in its basic aspects, in an essay written by a French police archivist).  The main character, Edmond Dant&egrave;s, is betrayed and falsely accused of treason, subsequently immured in a bleak and cruel prison, where he makes a fortunate acquaintance in the Abb&eacute; Faria, another wrongly accused prisoner, who eventually provides him with the education (both social and martial) and the financial means to exact revenge upon his accusers following his inevitable escape.  Upon achieving his freedom, Dant&egrave;s falls in with a crew of smugglers (giving him the disreputable, underworld connections that will prove so useful to him later), recovers a literal buried treasure bequeathed him by the Abb&eacute; Faria, and assumes the identity of an Italian nobleman, the titular Count of Monte Cristo, which opens the doors of aristocratic Parisian society, thus giving him access to his targets.  He then plots and carries out the downfall of all his enemies.  His revenge achieved, he then resumes his relationship with the beautiful woman to whom he was engaged prior to his arrest.  (In this last part, the movie departs completely from the novel, but I actually like this better; not only did I always feel sorry for Dumas' Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, who lost everything, and went off to live out the remainder of a rather broken, lonely life, but the woman with whom Dant&egrave;s eventually finds love, Hayd&eacute;e, always seemed to me a rather pale, colorless character, who serves little purpose in the story, and seems to exist only to provide Dant&egrave;s with a happy ending.)<br /><br />This is a film which, if memory serves, did moderately well at the box office, but no more than that.  For the life of me, I simply cannot fathom why that is.  Perhaps it's because it didn't have enough "action."  If that is so, it's a terrible commentary on how audiences' expectations have been dumbed down, and whose attention spans have been shortened by a steady diet of simple-minded action movie blockbusters over the past several decades.  Sure there is only one spectacular fight, but the film needs no more than this (and such things were signally lacking in the novel as well, where Edmond Dant&egrave;s achieve his revenge by plotting and intrigue, not by fisticuffs or swordplay).  I don't think the disappointment of ardent fans of the novel can explain why the film didn't enjoy better success, as I doubt that a majority of film goers these days have actually read all of it.  And I might as well mention, at this point, the harshest criticism that usually gets leveled at this film: that it doesn't do justice to the novel.  Every time I hear someone say this it makes me shake my head in exasperation.  The novel was over a thousand pages long, has a enormous cast of characters, several subplots unfolding beneath the main plot, and was originally serialized over the course of eighteen months during it's initial publication, which gave its readers plenty of time to digest the many twists and turns of the novel, and the way many characters' fates are interwoven and their stories overlap.  In just what world to these critics imagine one can "do justice" to a story this long and this complex in the course of a two-hour feature film?  OF COURSE the movie makes radical alterations to the story, omits nearly all the subplots, and eliminates most of the supporting characters.  There was no way to fit all that material in a feature length movie.  Even the 1998 French miniseries starring G&eacute;rard Depardieu couldn't accomplish this.  It would take at least a full season-long television series to do it in its entirety (hmmm... now THERE'S an idea!).  People should realize the movie is only based on and inspired by Dumas' superb novel, and enjoy the movie for what it is: a truly great film.<br /><br />So having said all that, I'll reiterate my wonder that this movie didn't do better at the box office.  It has something in it to appeal to literally everyone.  If you like adventure, look no further.  If romance is your thing, it's in there too.  Exotic, gorgeously scenic locations?  Got 'em.  In spades.  Do you love period films?  They don't come much better than this one.  Do you like suspense?  It's in there too.  Really, the film's got just about everything.  The story is marvelous, the pacing is pitch-perfect, the villains are appropriately contemptible without being clich&eacute;d  or cartoonish, the cinematography is brilliant, the locations are a sumptuous feast for the eyes (Malta stands in particularly well for early 19th-century Marseilles), the set and costume design is absolutely first-rate, and the acting is superb.  This last point is worth emphasizing.  Every actor turns in a great performance, and two in particular -- James Caviezel as Dant&egrave;s, and the late Richard Harris as the Abb&eacute; Faria -- are absolutely stellar.  If you've read and loved Dumas' novel, and haven't seen this yet, don't expect the original story to be faithfully reproduced on screen, and remember that it can't be in a two hour movie.  Instead, think of this film as a similar story, based on similar characters, but meant to be enjoyed entirely on its own merits.  Approach it on those terms, and you will be in for a positively wonderful cinematic experience.
 B000063W1R, A2ZDBOE1KHVHRA, netman "netman", 2/2, 5.0, 1254960000, Loved the book, Loved the movie!, One of my favorite movies!  I know Dumas admirers will strongly disagree, however I believe that this is one of the best adaptations ever.  Usually when Hollywood makes significant changes from the book, the results are horrendous.  Remember The Mists of Avalon?  Seriously, the book is great...one of the greatest and with all due respect, the changes made to the movie do enhance the story.  Some may complain about name changes and missing characters but get over it folks, the book is more than a 1000 pages and something had to be left out.  I don't want to give anything away but I felt that the romantic modifications with the Mercedes character actually improved on the Dumas story.  I always felt that he overly abused this character and I was happy to see her treated with more respect in the movie.<br /><br />Another thing that I (and my wife) liked about this movie is the fact that it is more plot oriented rather than action oriented.  It is not non-stop sword fighting.  There are many interesting subtle plot details that make this movie a keeper, one that can be watched over and over.  I especially enjoyed the section where Dantes has his awakening of sorts with assistance from the Abbe Faria within the prison.  How many of these elements did you catch the first time that you watched it?  Anyway, some people will bash any movie that does not precisely follow the book and really, this is impossible.  Lord of the Rings is probably the most successful and at 10 hours long, there were still parts left out.  Enjoy this movie and don't let the naysayers keep you from watching arguably the best Dumas adaptation yet.
 B000063W1R, A1YVPBDG2OFMD2, Leif Sheppard, 2/2, 5.0, 1246406400, "I don't believe in God!" "Doesn't matter...he believes in you.", First of all, let's get one thing out of the way. This film is an adaptation of a novel and as such it adds some new elements and deletes some others. (Note to book-to-film critics: Get over it.) A book and a film are two entirely different mediums and by definition one cannot be precisely parallel to the other, even if based on the same material. It's such a puerile, narrow-minded point of view to believe that a film has to mirror its source material with exact detail (something that, in many ways, is a wholly impossible task).<br /><br />Screenwriter Jay Wolpert, in a feature on the DVD, is asked how he responds to charges that his script greatly deviates from the novel. His response is to smile and say "Thank you! It wasn't my job to stay true to the book. My job was to make a movie, not film a book. If you want a dead-on version of the book - read the book. It's a good book! It's just not a movie." The point is that, in the end, the only thing that matters is that an excellent film has been made. It's with great pleasure, then, that I note that "The Count of Monte Cristo" is an outstanding adventure film that harkens back to a lost era.<br /><br />For starters, the film has a killer cast. Jim Caviezel makes for a pitch perfect Edmond Dantes. He adroitly conveys youthful, naive innocence at the beginning of the film and performs in an equally believable fashion as the older, wiser version of Dantes. You can see it in the way he walks, he carries himself differently, and he speaks with an assured resolve. Dantes time in prison has ravaged him to the point where he's left with only a single-minded determination to exact revenge at any cost. The transformation is sufficiently contrasted when Dantes first arrives back in Marseilles after his imprisionment. He's a slender, bearded, drab looking sort of fellow. At that moment, the film flashes back to Dantes earlier in the film, as the wide-eyed youthful boy who no longer exists.<br /><br />Guy Pearce, with his capacity for displaying the most elite arrogance at all the best moments, masterfully portrays the character of Fernand Mondego. Pearce captures the essence of Mondego, who can appear at times as a properly slick nobleman, but who is in reality unbelievably petty and hopelessly envious of Dantes. The stunningly beautiful (and undercast) Dagmara Dominczyk creates a terrific interpretation of Mercedes, the fiance of Dantes and eventual wife of Mondego. In many ways, she undergoes as vital a transformation as Dantes during her unhappy marriage. She feels trapped and isolated to the extent that she is wearily resigned to her fate. It isn't until Dantes reappears that she realizes there is a way out, and watching her character come to life should bring a smile to nearly anyone.<br /><br />The great Richard Harris, cast as Abbe Faria, is able to firmly establish the complexity of his character even though he is only in the film for about a half hour, a remarkable feat to be certain. Harris is one of the highlights in the film, and even injects a bit of levity into the story. For instance, when Dantes initially scoffs at the idea of Faria's idea of taking eight years to tunnel out of the prison, he responds "Does something else demand your time? Some pressing appointment, perhaps?" In his darker moments, such as when Faria is telling Dantes of his past misdeeds, it's clear that Harris delves deep within his own recesses to deliver the regret in his lines. Just listen to the well of emotion he is able to tap into when he delivers lines such as "I was ordered to burn down the church with them inside it." "Did you?", Dantes asks. "To my everlasting shame I did. . .I did."<br /><br />Edward Shearmur provides an appropriately sweeping score, the type which remains in your mind long after the film has ended. As for the cinematography, it is extraordinarily gorgeous. Filmed primarily in Ireland and Malta, the feature takes great pains to capture the sights and sounds of the era. It's astonishing the effort and detail put into the sets and seems so regrettable that, as Guy Pearce mentioned in a feature on the DVD, it was all simply torn down after filming. During the same feature, it details some of the production work such as the fact that the crew had the massive, imposing fountain in the carnivale scene custom made in England and shipped to Malta specially for that one scene.<br /><br />"The Count of Monte Cristo" is a sprawling story with dozens of characters and a myriad of threads. Any film is faced with quite a tall order attempting to condense the novel into only two hours of screentime. This film makes this massive missive into a concise and accessible package, which will no doubt encourage audiences to revisit the novel and take in all the extra nuances there. All the highlights from the novel are presented while all of the excess baggage is jettisoned. Further, the additions to the story (especially the revelation Albert's parentage) make for excellent cinematic moments. This film recalls the golden age of adventure films in that it is expertly paced, wonderfully filmed, and can be watched by audiences of any age.<br /><br />The DVD contains four major supplementary features including a superb making-of special titled "An Epic Reborn". Spanning over thirty minutes, this feature covers the life of the author Alexandre Dumas, an interview with the screenwriter, a look into creating the Napoleonic world including some set design, and a segment with the swordfight choreographer detailing how he plans and executes the swashbuckling scenes. Also of note are four deleted scenes, one of which is actually an alternate version of a scene, and all included with (non-optional) commentary with the director and film editor. Rounding out the features is a split-screen scene showing the multi-camera angles used and one complete scene from the film with all the audio components on different tracks, allowing the user to switch between them. The only thing missing is a theatrical trailer, but with the advent of the internet this can be viewed any time one wishes anyway.
 B000063W1R, A14NA0W8ESGDSI, Timothy Lovett, 2/2, 4.0, 1207440000, Enjoyable For Those Who Never Read the Book, Personally, I never read the book this story is based on so I think my look into the movie is on a movie itself scale which would be entirely different if you read the book.<br /><br />That said, the movie is fantastic in my opinion. As a viewer I was instantly pulled into the storyline and consistently brought to the edge of my seat moment after moment waiting for the next piece of action to occur. And I find it hard to believe but the moments when his revenge is enacted I felt a personal joy seeing Dante take it.<br /><br />The story itself, as mentioned by others as well, is about a man who is betrayed, locked away in a prison forever, forgotten, freed by a chance situation, given a great treasure, and with the means to do it given a chance to take revenge for being wronged.<br /><br />Yes, at times Dante is extravagant, as mentioned in other reviews, but I think the director was interweaving the current culture into the story to better adapt it to the audience so perhaps this was a necessary change. With our semi-materialistic world view where the bigger and flashier the more exciting it probably seemed like a good choice to keep us entertained. Yes, in the time of the book's release this would have been seen as silly but it keeps audiences today interested which perhaps is more important.<br /><br />Anyhow, this movie is a solid, fun, exciting movie and while it's not the sort you'll see reviewed as a groundbreaking gem to add to your collection it's definitely worth having if only to whip out from time to time. You'll enjoy this one.
 B000063W1R, A1KMDI5N5ZT85T, Mylo's Mom, 2/2, 5.0, 1206835200, Such an underrated movie!!, I happened to catch this movie on television and loved it so much that I had to buy it.  It is a great story of such well-calculated revenge and the perfect example of "what goes around comes around".<br /><br />Others have complained that the filmmakers took quite a bit of "artistic freedom" in adapting the book to the movie format.  I guess I really don't mind that this was done.  Each individual work -- the book and the movie -- can stand alone as a well-crafted, entertaining story.  Many purists disagree, but that's what's great about reviews:  everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion.<br /><br />If you can look past the differences between the book and the movie, I think you will find that this is truly an enjoyable adventure.
 B000063W1R, A3NPQO93S1ENI8, Richard Laborde, 2/2, 5.0, 1188777600, More satisfying for an old man., I found this version more satifyling than the one with Richard Chamberline. Although the Caviezel version does not follow the book, the "boy getting the girl" in the end offers more satisfaction
 B000063W1R, A10ODC971MDHV8, John Farr, 2/2, 5.0, 1185321600, The Count of Monte Cristo, Director Reynolds fashions a handsome, sweeping, exciting epic that keeps his audience glued in place. Pearce's Fernand is so despicably low, we cannot wait for the long-suffering Edmond to wreak vengeance. In this hugely entertaining picture, revenge is a dish served hot, and adventure fans are sure to feel sated by the end. Also, solid family viewing- with older children.
 B000063W1R, AI0P5DBIEN5RT, Carolyn "Quiltek", 2/2, 5.0, 1183680000, Count of Monte Cristro, I have loved to watch this movie from the day it hit the movie theaters.  I now own it and watch it often.
 B000063W1R, A7415KR7WH7CX, J. Amend, 2/2, 4.0, 1175126400, The Count of Monte Cristo, I got it for my mom.  She really likes it.
 B000063W1R, A13F8LV1XX4UHQ, Cindy T. Morgan, 2/2, 5.0, 1174348800, Great love story with a moral, One of the best movies I've seen.  Makes me feel good every time I watch it.  The good guys win.
 B000063W1R, AD8CNMZFHUN1D, J. Scott Ezzell, 2/2, 5.0, 1165276800, one of my favorites, A classic story with great acting. Great adventure. A great lesson in faith, endurance, courage. Maybe a little intense for young kids.
 B000063W1R, A2SPHTIPK9IKDQ, Anony Mous, 2/2, 4.0, 1146614400, Not The Real Story, But..., If you want to see the actual Dumas story, then don't watch this movie. But if you want to view an excellent movie, loosely based on the original, then DO see this movie! The film makers have gone out of their way to make the story more exciting, intriguing, and even satisfying (in places) than the original. Whereas the original is quite talky, this version is full of action, suspense, and drama--with an enjoyable satisfying climax. The acting and directing is excellent. Definitely worth seeing!
 B000063W1R, A37IL8B2RL95PL, Becky Hatfield "book fire wolf", 2/2, 4.0, 1146441600, You Can Count On Revenge, The Count of Monte Cristo is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. Starring the handsome Jim Caviezel in the lead role of Edmond Dantes and the Count, the story takes you on a nonstop ride of adventure. Also starring Guy Pearce as his best friend turned enemy The Count Mondego. The Count of Monte Cristo will leave you breathless. Revenge is sweet for after being wrongly convicted of a crime, Edmond is sent to prison for 13 years, were he meets a compassionate priest played by Richard Harris. After the sudden death of the priest and the joyest escape, Edmond sets out on a journey of revenge. Slowly taking everything from his ex-best friend the Count Mondego, Edmond who is now the Count of Monte Cristo, hatches a plan to seek the ultimate revenge against the people who had plotted to ruin his life. With period costume designs by Tom Rand, and under the very capable direction of Kevin Reynolds, The Count of Monte Cristo is an adventure waiting to happen, with a few twists on the way.
 B000063W1R, A2GRC6IJRA7W4H, HeadbangerDuh, 2/2, 5.0, 1105228800, Why does everyone hate this film?, I just can't understand why everyone hates this movie! Of all the adventure films Iv'e seen (which is a lot, by the way), this is my all-time favorite. Yes I like it better than Return of the King, Mask of Zorro, Pirates of The Carribbean, anything. It is a fun and entertaining swashbuckler set in 1800's France. Here is the story:<br /><br />Edmond Dantes (Jim Cavieziel) is a young sailor who is about to marry very beautiful Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk, in her best role). But his so-called friend, Fernand (Guy Pearce) betrays him and Edmond is sent to jail for 13 years. When he escapes, he finds millions of dollars in gold, and he uses this money to get into Fernand and Mercedes' lives to take revenge on them. Lots of swashbuckling and great acting ensues.<br /><br />But I beg you, do not listen to the reviewers who knock this movie to death. This is the best movie ever made, and if you don't like it, you just don't like movies.
 B000063W1R, A3760PCQD2MPIO, Laura Lond, 2/2, 4.0, 1062028800, What I like about this movie, I was going to leave a review saying something like, "Apart from the book, it's a good movie - but poor Mr. Dumas!  If I were him, I'd rise from the grave to haunt those filmmakers for what they did to my story..."  But then I saw all these excellent reviews here that had already addressed the subject and gave detailed explanations of how the movie was different from the book, what parts were changed the most, and whether those changes were justified. So I guess I will not repeat what has already been said so well; instead, I'll just tell you what I personally liked about the movie.<p>First of all I would like to say that whenever the movie mentions God, it is done in a very appropriate way, neither profane nor preachy. Another accomplishment that goes along the same line is the portrayal of Faria, who is a believer and at the same time a respectable figure. There have always been jerks among Christians, but there have always been admirable people as well. Sometimes moviemakers seem to forget that part.<p>Another reviewer mentioned that they appreciated not having to cover their kids' eyes because there were no sexually explicit scenes in the movie. I agree; there was one somewhat close, but it could have been so much worse since there is a love story involved. <p>Overall, it is a good movie. Love, friendship, betrayal, long suffering, fantastic escape, instant riches, revenge - everything you need for a great adventure, plus a deeper meaning to ponder.
 B000063W1R, AMI43JPFFO2TN, "ropes7339", 2/2, 4.0, 1012867200, A Classic Rush From a Classic Action Film, "The Count of Monte Cristo" is a rendition of Dumas' 1844 novel.  It portrays the life of Edmond Dantes, a man falsly accused treason.  He is imprisoned for 13 years, and vows revenge on those who betrayed him.  Once he breaks out, he uncovers a ledgendary treasure, and buys a life as a count.  With this, he calculates his plan to avenge his life.  "The Count of Monte Cristo" is a film that encompasses action, drama, and even a little bit of comedy.  Guy Pearce ("Memento," "Ravenous") is phenomenal as the archetypal villian, and James Caviezel ("Angel Eyes," "Frequency") is very convincing.  It is a very classic action film ala "The Three Musketeers." (Coincidentally by the same author.... hmmmm)  "Count" on a good time with "The Count of Monte Cristo."
 B000063W1R, AEM0D3OFOR9RQ, Sara, 2/2, 5.0, 1012089600, Pleasantly Surprised, Going into the film I expected a good time, watching an okay movie and hanging with some pals. What I got was a good time, hanging with pals and watching an excellent movie! The much-filmed story gets restyled with youthful actors and an interesting script, not to mention the intriguing story. The story I am speaking of is that of Edmond Dantes (played with innocence and then anger by Jim Caviezel) who seems to be riding the high life with a new job as captain and a beautiful fiancee until he is arrested for treason. What Edmond doesn't know (at first) is that he has been set up by his jealous friend Ferdinand (played with evil smarmyness by Guy Pearce). With such high caliber acting and beautiful settings, it's tough not to be completely drawn into this story. I highly recommend that if you're going to the theaters this weekend, that you check this one out.
 B000063W1R, A3EXIM9H3PLDX9, Megan "Avid reader and movie watcher", 4/5, 5.0, 1159315200, What's better than a hot guy getting revenge?, When I first saw this movie, I was surfing the limited channels on our television a week or so ahead of the time they would actually come on so that I could catch any that sounded promising. This was one of those. The description sounded good and a few of the actors' names sounded familiar, although I had never seen any of their movies to date.<br /><br />So, last night when my sister and I had nothing to do, we decided to switch it on. And let me tell you. It was worth it. Though a little confusing at times, I found this movie highly enjoyable. It also made sense, which was good. There seemed to be a reason for everything.<br /><br />And, okay I'll just say it. One of the main reasons this is such a good movie is because Jim Caviezel was the main character. Like I said, I had never seen any of his movies (and I still haven't exept for this one, of course) so, I was somewhat surprised to see how hot he was. I mean, yes, it did take some time for me to see the full extent of it, but when I did, I couldn't stop talking and thinking about it.<br /><br />You would think that it was utterly impossible for a man to look hot in all the stages of his life, miserable as it was at times. I mean, he looked hot in every single scene. Especially as the Count.<br /><br />Basically this is a movie about revenge. Edmund Dontes is in love with this girl named Mercedees, but can't marry her because he is too poor to buy a ring. He is charged with high treason for delivering a letter for someone, and is sent to prison at a horrible place where he stays for 13 years. Meanwhile Mercedees and his best friend, who actually helped frame him, get married. Edmund escapes and finds all this treasure and gets really rich. He then decides to get revenge on everyone who wronged him.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie. I wouldn't give it five stars though. Probably about 4.5 or something. But Jim Caviezel helps a bunch. He is a really good actor. I guess you won't know 'til you watch it.
 B000063W1R, A2BN2CP2LDD8QJ, Eric Johnsen, 4/5, 4.0, 1138579200, Excellent movie, This movie provides one of the best film interpretations of Dumas' book I've seen.  Although much of the plot is cut out, realistically this movie is a great adaptation of an amazing book.  If you choose to see this movie, be sure to read the unabridged version of the book as well.  Even if you're not in it for the literature, this movie is an exciting watch regardless.
 B000063W1R, A2CBIB1NYHOH87, Juan J. Casero, 4/5, 3.0, 1110067200, Good but not great, Because I read the Count of Monte Cristo in it's entirety three times in high school I was disappointed with the liberties the director has taken in this cinematic version of the film.  It starts out fine but about 1/5th of the way into the movie it begins to depart dramatically from the book.  I guess if you have never read the book the movie might be ok but I was so hoping to see the whole story of the Count of Monte Cristo told in all it's glory in the DVD.  The story line is based loosely on the story as written by Alexandre Dumas but it departs in very significant ways from the book so much so that by the end it doesn't resemble the book at all.
 B000063W1R, A25AXWGBGJ5KBS, M J Heilbron Jr. "Dr. Mo", 4/5, 4.0, 1092700800, Tremendously entertaining!, Now THIS is the way more movies should be! This is an old-fashioned, well-made, well-acted, exciting, interesting film, telling a fine tale in a fine fashion.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the sets and locations are flat-out breathtaking...<br /><br />"The Count of Monte Cristo" is the name of one of those books you were either forced to read in high school, or the name of a book you wanted to read but never got around to it.<br /><br />This movie will a) make you re-read the book because it was clearly better than you remember or b) make you go out and buy the book immediately.<br /><br />A synopsis is not necessary; there are a few hundred written below.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce are terrific, as they usually are. Richard Harris' turn as Priest is effective as well.<br /><br />The story deviates from the novel in ways that make it a better two-hour movie. This is not a word-for-word adaptation; it's not meant to be. There are some fairly major deviations, but they honestly make for a better film. The film is not meant to supplant the book...but BOY does it make you want to go read.<br /><br />And THAT's high praise indeed!
 B000063W1R, A2UBFC3U1ZU7C8, Charles Ryder, 4/5, 3.0, 1066867200, Don't judge a book by its movie, Only an eternal optimist expects great things from a book-to-screen adaptation.  This  optimist expected at least good things from this 2002 version of Dumas' classic tale of revenge, mostly due to the casting of Guy Pearce and James Caviezel.  But just a few short minutes into the film, it becomes apparent that this was going to be the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; in name only.<p>In my view the power of the book rests in the character of Edmond Dantes (later the Count).  In the film version, Monte Cristo is depicted as a rich fool, unable to command respect and totally devoid of subtlety: witness the deus ex machina hot air balloon entrance of the Count onto the Paris scene.  How absurd! In Dumas' exquisite story, Monte Cristo wielded an unquestionable power over all he came in contact with.  Quite the opposite is true of Caviazel's Cristo.  But this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  The movie lacks character development of even the few antagonists and protagonists it chose to include.  As one reviewer noted, the book Monte Cristo was able turn his enemies into monkeys, while this film just makes a monkey of itself.<p>Taken as completely separate from the book, this is a decent film.  The acting, costume and set design, and action sequences are very respectable. This is an average movie in and of itself.  It becomes less than average strictly because of its association with a sublime work of French literature, which is resembles not.
 B000063W1R, A2D6TWLYZ0Z6O9, "reia", 4/5, 4.0, 1032998400, Fun is had by all., If you've ever wondered where the good adventure films have gone, look no more.  The Count of Monte Cristo is a fun romp into a classic Dumas work.  Swordfights, escape sequences, and interesting characters played perfectly are sprinkled around this work.  Jim Caviezel is perfect in his role: quietly powerful.  He manages to go from wide-eyed innocence from the beginning to steely cynicism as he wallows in Chateau D'If for crimes he didn't commit.  Dagmara Dominczyk is beautiful and fills the &quot;requirements&quot; needed for Caviezel's romantic interest -- however, the woman needs to learn how to enunciate her words better.  Mumbling is not very becoming.<p>In contrast, Guy Pearce's Fernand is a joy to behold.  Pearce takes his character to the extreme, much to the audience's delight.  Richard Harris's Abbe Faria is also great to watch.<p>My only real quibble with the film is the horrid cinematography during the evening scenes, and in some of the prison scenes.  Yes, it is supposed to be dark.  But the lack of lighting during the opening sequences and the escape scene dampened the excitement.  You can't get excited over a fight you can't see.  And I was watching this film on a 36&quot; Sony XBR flat screen.  If I couldn't see anything, no one can.
 B000063W1R, A3BXC8JS7FNH0Y, Lucy Dibdin, 4/5, 4.0, 1019347200, Two hours of totally escapist entertainment!, It won't trouble the Oscar voters, it won't stimulate intense discussion and debate, but by crikey, this adaptation of Dumas' classic novel will make you forget about the drudgery of life for a couple of hours.<p>This, in my opinion, is Kevin Reynolds best film since Fandango...and it's been some time!  He sticks to a formula of being fairly true to the book and keeping it simple - doing just enough to produce a piece of total entertainment.  He is of course working with great source material, and yes, we all know the story, but it's still great fun and thoroughly enjoyable.<p>Jim Caviezel is simply spot on as the hard-done-by-hero Edmund Dantes.  As he showed in Angel Eyes, no-one does doe-eyed innocence like Jim, and he simply smoulders as the vengeful Count.  He has the screen presence of a 1940s movie idol - tall, broad, quiet and dignified - and you thought they didn't make 'em like that anymore! And, as he demonstrated in The Thin Red Line and Frequency, he is a fine actor. If they have any sense, producers will be queuing up to give him the sort of meaty roles that will guarantee him leading man status.<p>Guy Pearce has fun as the evil Count Mondego. Kudos to the hair-dressing department for creating a "do" worthy of Best Supporting Hair Piece status, but I think he thinks he is Alan Rickman in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves, but he just doesn't quite cut it.  <p>The leading lady is suitably beautiful and Richard Harris again turns in a scene-stealing supporting performance.<p>Yes, there are big old holes in the plot, but, if you're willing to check your brain at the door and be entertained, then buy a big bucket of popcorn, put your feet up and enjoy every minute of action and every frame of fabulous scenery in this movie.  Yes, it is fluff...but marvellously escapist fluff at that.  In a time of such horror and violence in the world, a film like this is surprisingly welcome.
 B000063W1R, A6EGKP0KY5B1A, juvimama, 1/1, 1.0, 1350345600, Disappointed, The DVD was from the wrong region - didn't even know that was possible. So irritated I didn't want to mess with return process.Still don't have my DVD,  ) :
 B000NDFLWG, A3GYVMUS7SSDFW, Kyle Tolle, 17/18, 5.0, 1181606400, Borrow now, pay later - an American way of life, Americans spend more money than they make and that's the modern trend in today's society.  This stems from the fact that it is so convenient to live this way but it is also a progressive danger to consumers and the economy.<br />The public faces a daily barrage of advertisements for credit cards and lending options and it filters down to everyone in all walks of life.  In 2005 alone, the top 10 credit card companies spent over 2 billion dollars in advertising.<br /><br />Commercials have been shown to use subtle and creative messages to tap into your subconscious desire to spend money but no attempts are made to educate individuals about any fiscal responsibilities.  The situation is even worse when you realize that many companies have inflated interest rates, they overcharge on late fees, and some often misappropriate confidential consumer information such as you personal credit history.<br /><br />Looking at the dilemma of this debt crisis begs the question of what is going wrong.  A big element is the fact that rising costs of healthcare, housing, education, and consumer goods hurts so many and credit and lending play a significant part here.  The federal government is another factor that does not favor the consumer and hurts you more than it helps.  Recent bankruptcy reform initiated by President Bush now makes it more difficult for persons to file bankruptcy and recover from financial hardship.  Powerful lobbyists in Washington are very influential in helping to manipulate fiscal policies and financial institutions are the number one contributors to political campaigns.<br /><br />There really isn't any happy ending in sight to this widespread problem but there is a growing light at the end of the tunnel.  Consumer advocate groups are becoming more prominent nowadays and their attempts at debt education and awareness are steadily working their way into mainstream society.  Any type of help whatsoever is productive and necessary for everyone affected and this keeps the hope alive that we can eventually make significant progress in overcoming our huge dependency on borrowed money and credit.<br /><br />`In Debt We Trust' really appealed to me because it was quite comprehensive in how much material it covered and because it was presented in an easy to understand and straightforward manner.  For informational and educational purposes, I would seriously recommend this documentary to everyone.
 B000NDFLWG, AJYGQV81FSFE2, Timothy P. Scanlon, 13/13, 4.0, 1198022400, A problem for all of us..., About 2/3 through this film, the director, Danny Schecter, talks about the predatory and devestating effects of the "subprime" lending formula. As that has become an issue of late, you might see the film as a prophecy, and a sign the the bubble is, indeed, bursting.<br /><br />I feel compelled to point out that a few 1-star reviewers saw this DVD as an indictment of Bush. Those people either didn't see it or had such a pro-Bush bias that they didn't hear Schecter and those he interviewed repeatedly saying that it pervades both parties!<br /><br />And another important reflection: the standard line when credit issues come up is something those of us allegedly on "the left" ignore, i.e., individual responsibility. Did you really have to buy that flat screen TV? I won't deny that, but nor will I deny that the very basis of our whole economic culture is CONSUMPTION. That stuff is shoved down our throats all the time. Indeed, if people would refrain from that sort of consumption, the US economy would fall apart in a week. So there are two sides to that as well. In fact, there is a portion of the film which describes stores in the "low income neighborhoods of color" in NYC which have "rent to own" shops where people will end up paying $750 for a television they could get for $195 at a mall. What's more, it doesn't do us much good to ignore individual responsibility, but why not acknowledge the responsibility of those pressing and making the loans--off of which they're making obscene profits--too! Or are they responsible for nothing?<br /><br />The film begins with a Baptist congregation in Norfolk, VA where the congregation helps out members who've gone bankrupt. They bail out that person and decry being in debt. The story continues in chapters, based on who's going bankrupt (including actress Lorraine Bracco of "The Sopranos." What? A movie star can go broke??) and why.<br /><br />It covers the predatory companies. Ironic, I just saw it ten minutes ago and am still processing the whole concept. I guess I relate to it as I've been saying the same thing for a long time. When I went overseas as a professional 30 years ago, my boss did not qualify for a credit card (so, needless to say, nor did I). I was in my 30s when I got my first credit card. When I moved to the area where I live now and got a job at the national HQ of an association, a colleague of mine joked that his high school son got junk mail for credit cards daily. That's how "easy" it was/is to get credit. The film too discusses with young people the debt they've incurred because of such cards. (One young woman had spent the last nine years paying off half her $16,000 in credit card bills, and felt it'd take her as much to pay off the next half. In the meantime, there are credit companies galore giving credit cards to freshman at a Rochester, NY institution).<br /><br />And credit cards aren't the only culprits. The film went over tax deals, in which people are given loans at an outrageous rate as an advance on their tax return, the "rent to own" shops like I referred to above, again, the subprime loan rates, any number of means that the wealthy will make a lot of money off the shrinking middle class.<br /><br />Again, back to the "nonpartisanship," there's a portion of the film in which a conservative radio talk show host sponsors a seminar on cutting up credit cards. So it's not a conservative bashing story at all.<br /><br />Toward the end of the film, you might say it ends with a "metaphor." A helicopter with a number of executives of one of the larger credit predators in the US went down in the East River in NY. The executives were rescued, but one of those scholars being interviewed said that, while he wouldn't wish such a disaster on anyone, in effect, they may have "had it coming" more than anyone else. Then the film returns to the congregation in Norfolk because that's the home of a large naval base. And even troops and sailors returning from Iraq are being victimized by the 26 or so shops that give the returning troops instant money so they don't have to wait for their paychecks. But that money comes at a BIG price, still another dimension of the credit industry. (Some are taking out one loan to pay off the last, time and time again!)<br /><br />Overall, I think it's important that people, young and not so young, see this film. What I wish it had stressed more is that it's not just consumption of the frivolous that puts many of us in debt. It's also unforseen medical expenses and the type of bills we can't avoid that are also driving many of us into the foreclosures and bankruptcies which were the real subject of the film. I mean, that was covered, but needed to have been stressed more.<br /><br />Overall, though, Danny, thanks. We needed to see this.
 B000NDFLWG, A39F5HLWQEZD7E, Vickie Beene Beavers "vbeene", 3/3, 5.0, 1190764800, Great DVD for a high school classroom, Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film! It lays out the important issue of personal finance very clear. At some point, young adults will see how important maintaining good credit, mastering a budget and committing to saving will pay off--for good or for bad.
 B000NDFLWG, A21SBJ6QU1C4IX, Bonnie, 4/5, 5.0, 1184803200, Go Danny Go!, Keep up the good work Danny!<br />I hope you do another documentary on this ever expanding problem.<br />Reward cards are something that need looking at more closely.<br />Who is actually paying these "rewards". It's the merchant fees that we all pay for whether we use credit cards or not! Fact is, many people can't use a reward card or simply don't want to deal with greedy credit card co's and their long list of dirty tricks and yet they don't get a discount when they pay cash because everywhere you go, they take credit cards. And that means merchant fees that we all pay in the form of higher prices!  And these card co's have it set up so the merchants can't give a lower price for cash customers! It's outrageous!<br />And I hope you do more about debt buyers. It's insane these co's can buy debt for pennies on the dollar and then pile on more interest.  Interest is supposed to be charged for money borrowed!  Nobody borrowed money from a debt buyer and yet they can charge interest! It doesn't make any sense to put someone in debt further.<br />And last but not least, these predators who flood the mailboxes of the newly bankrupt should not be allowed to send them any mail for at least ten years. That is the amount of time bankruptcy remains on someones credit report. If the newly bankrupt want to get back in the credit card game, then let them find these cos. There should be a law that these co's with their dreadful offers not be allowed to send offers to those who have just gotten out of bankruptcy. Unfortunatly, some will not understand these offers or will be desperate. They are nothing but a trap wrapped in envelopes with seductive message like "we want to help you re establish your credit" or "you deserve a second chance". Those who have filed bankruptcy have gotten a second chance and these predators only want a second chance at ripping them off and putting them in debtors prison again! These co's will even extend credit to people living below the poverty line!!
 B000NDFLWG, APX3HA2INR9QM, Desiree "Desiree", 8/11, 3.0, 1187308800, Interesting But Incomplete, This is a very good documentary on the subject of credit card debt and predatory lending, but doesn't pack the emotional punch of a similar documentary titled Maxed Out that came out roughly at the same time.  The documentary shows as a society that the middle and lower classes are drowning in a sea of debt from payday loan places and credit card debt.  It offers some good advice and gives a lot of cause for concern, but leaves you with a feeling of unanswered questions and wanting more information.  It does however show you that debt is often not caused by stupidity or foolishness but by circumstances that could affect any one of us.
 B000NDFLWG, AR2ZNBYLIUYQ6, Timegoesby, 1/1, 1.0, 1333670400, Learned Nothing, One thing I want to point out about this documentary is it starts out talking about personal credit card debt and approximately 30 mins into the documentary starts to talk about national debt and how much national debt the U.S. owes. In economics, personal credit card debt and the national debt are two very different issues. I find it dishonest that the filmmakers would mislead consumers by lumping both types of debt together - they are separate issues and need to be addressed as such.<br /><br />I would agree with the part of the film where it states "debt is a much larger symptom of economic and structural issues facing households" and that "households are facing declining and stagnating incomes while costs are skyrocketing". I certainly agree that public policy must be changed to address such issues, however, the film barely touched upon this topic.<br /><br />I kept waiting to hear solutions the film would propose to address personal credit card debt in this nation - whether those solutions be on a personal or national level. In the end, the film gave about a 5-minute soundbite on the how this issue needs to be addressed at the community level.<br /><br />Overall, poorly organized documentary that goes off on tangents. The mention of faith-based solutions at the end without elaborating on what such solutions are rounded off an already weak movie.
 B000NDFLWG, A1TK6WNUIAEQRU, stoic, 1/1, 4.0, 1266537600, Slaves to Our Debts, In Debt We Trust warns that the U.S. economy is heading for collapse due to our massive borrowing. Given the current state of the economy (and the role that mortgage debt played in the crisis), the filmmakers appear to have been prescient. I don't think that this is a perfect film, but it held my attention.<br /><br />The filmmakers score points when they discuss the marketing of credit cards to young people, especially college students. The film includes stories from many people about the problems their debts have created for them. In one good scene, the filmmakers pawn a car title; the scene is both entertaining and educational.<br /><br />This film travels much of the same ground as another documentary, Maxed Out. Both films include clips from the same film. I like both films, but I prefer Maxed Out because the material seems a bit fresher. I also think that the filmmakers should have included more material about the need for Americans to take some responsibility for managing their debts and becoming financially literate.<br /><br />In Debt We Trust does a great job of starting a conversation - about debt - that is long overdue in the U.S. Given that about 2/3 of our economy is based on consumer spending, I am pessimistic that the government will do anything to discourage debt. Individuals, however, are free to choose a different path for themselves.
 B000NDFLWG, A37FUJC2L7DSPT, J. L LaRegina "Jim LaRegina", 1/1, 5.0, 1252540800, The usurious state of America, While on vacation several years ago my wife and I got roped into a timeshare presentation.  At the end, I told the salesman, "We don't have the money for it."<br /><br />He smiled, saying, "Finance!"<br /><br />Finance vacation?  A house and a car are the only purchases for which one should borrow money.  And I'm not even sure about borrowing for a car as I pay cash for mine, but then, I buy only used models.<br /><br />The documentary IN DEBT WE TRUST shows just how legal loan-sharking has become in the United States.  Credit card companies and subprime mortgage lenders break Americans who have not already lost their shirts to unemployment and medical bills.  Perhaps no one forces people into the traps of A.P.R.s and A.R.M.s, but this film demonstrates how the creditors hoodwink their victims.  Holding a gun on them would be honest, at least.  IN DEBT WE TRUST includes testimonials from people who should have put off that vacation rather than take a loan for it or kept renting rather than buy a home.  That smiling timeshare salesman may as well have told me, "A place to go on vacation every year?  Priceless."<br /><br />And what do America's leaders have to say as this consumption culture destroys people's finances? As George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani said shortly after the 9/11 terror attack, "Go shopping."  Later, Bush would sign a bill limiting Americans' bankruptcy options.<br /><br />See IN DEBT WE TRUST.

 B000WI23KA, A1RBMOHIBUBC4U, Jennifer Rowland "ICANREAD!", 5/5, 5.0, 1211673600, Wonderful portrait of Van Gogh, I have been obsessed with Van Gogh, since I first laid eyes on his originals in L.A.. Prints of his work just don't show the awe inspiring life force that emanates from his paintings.<br />" Through the Eyes of Van Gogh" is a sensitive and intense work of art in itself. It achieves an externalization of Van Gogh's internal struggles of trying to make a living, trying to relate to others, trying to hold on to his unique vision of art and his brave battle with mental illness, all of which he felt he failed at, at the time of his suicide.<br />I feel this film brilliantly achieves looking through the eyes of Van Gogh, by focusing on his time in the mental hospital with the addition of flashbacks to pivotal points in his life. The writer, who is also the actor who portrays Vincent, has created a portrait of Van Gogh that is as palpable as his paintings.
 B000WI23KA, A1GHO6BR5J0NHX, Richard Masloski, 2/2, 5.0, 1331510400, POIGNANT and PROFOUND, Who is Alexander Barnett?<br /><br />He is the man who wrote, directed and stars in what is arguably the most poignant and profound portrayal of Vincent van Gogh ever put on film. There have been many movie Van Goghs: Kirk Douglas' rendition in LUST FOR LIFE is magisterial.  But despite the intense veracity of Vincente Minnelli's 1956 film, there were warts beneath the warts in the actual history that just didn't make it to the screen in that lavish and rich outing.  Robert Altman offered a grimmer and grimier version of things in VINCENT AND THEO and Tim Roth gave us a more insular artist - whereby from all historic accounts the destined Dutchman was extremely demonstrative and vocal and all over the place.  Jacques Dutronc's turn with the paint brush in VAN GOGH was likewise introspect in a biopic that flung facts around as wildly as Van Gogh flung paint anywhere and everywhere in his frenzied attack of the nihilistic blankness of the ever-goading canvas.<br /><br />In Alexander Barnett - through his raw,ragged and really realistic THE EYES OF VAN GOGH - we have an actor who seems to be channeling the actual spirit of the artist.  For starters, he looks probably the closest to what Van Gogh probably looked like - given that there are no photographs of him as an adult and all we have to go by are his many variegated self-portraits.  There are many sequences in this film wherein I felt I was actually looking at the real man, as if caught on some time machine of a film camera.  But beyond the outward, it is in the probing of the inward that Mr. Barnett excels.  From start to finish, he never loses Van Gogh in himself.  There is not a false note in the performance.  His acting is a veritable acting class in and of itself.  If he and this film had ever been elibigle, his is a performance supremely worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />The script is sublime.  In it, Mr. Barnett dares to bravely show us the darkest sides of Van Gogh.  These scenes are painful to watch, if one is totally sold on the Van Gogh-as-Saint interpretation of history.  Yet balanced with that blackness, shown are all of the reasons why  - as Don McClean sings in STARRY NIGHT -<br />"this world was never meant for one as beautiful" as Vincent.  If Mr. Barnett's script were only available in printed form, it would still be (in addition to being historically accurate and revealing)intense and exciting to read but - in the finished film - these scenes are enacted with such passion and pathos that they seem less acted than lived. As directed by Mr. Barnett, there is a John Cassavettes-like sense of improvisation and therefore total reality that packs one tremendous emotional wallop after another.  And like Cassavettes and even Welles in certain instances, Mr. Barnett holds many scenes for incredible amounts of time that lesser directors would be too timid to even attempt.  These long, unedited sequences carefully build the utter sense of reality that Mr. Barnett was evidently after and has so eminently achieved.  We, as viewers, become part of what we are watching - in ways that are quite rare to most movies.<br /><br />Also in this immense film there are many set-pieces and images that will stay with one for a long, long time.  Haunting sequences and rivetting images that are imaginativey conceived and expertly, flawlessly delivered.  One example is when Vincent imagines/dreams/fantasizes/hallucinates the death of his beloved brother.  After the "imaginary" sequence there is a sharp cut to Vincent sitting up in his asylum bed in the middle of the night, crying and cradling what is apparent emptiness - but is, instead, the impossible thought of a lost Theo.  Brilliantly, in this one sequence alone, this one image of Vincent cradling "emptiness", volumes are spoken - for in the event of losing Theo, Vincent would indeed be cradling emptiness.  But in the larger context, this one image of Vincent cradling "emptiness" in the middle-of-the-night speaks largely and painfully for most of the whole of his life.  It is in such brilliant, often worldless scenes and sequences that Mr. Barnett's vision explodes from the film frame as passionately and as profoundly as Vincent van Gogh's vision exploded from his canvas frames and bathed the world in color and gave us a new way of seeing. As Van Gogh's work transcended the bounds of its frames, so also does Mr. Barnett's film transcend the boundaries of the movie or television screen. In both instances, with both artists, Art does what it so rarely does.  Art... becomes Life.
 B000WI23KA, A1R0VUVAIDXKOT, Nate F, 1/1, 5.0, 1287100800, The Eyes of Van Gogh, A remarkably sincere, honest, HUMAN insight into the pain Van Gogh endured. There's something humble and heartfelt about Alexander Barnett's performance that seems to me to be the most realistic portrayal of Van Gogh I have yet seen.
 B000WI23KA, A5QDZTTB2R1Q2, Ashley March, 1/1, 5.0, 1201737600, Nine  opinions from Imdb.com ratings., Author: sayitwithmusic from United States<br /><br />History tells us that Van Gogh, like many artists, was a very intense and troubled personality. Barnett takes us into the heart and mind of the man in a way that causes us to empathize afresh with his feelings and struggles. Barnett the film-maker deliberately refrains from any cutting from one camera to another, enhancing the viewer's being drawn into the world as viewed from Van Gogh's perspective. The score is also effective in painting an aural picture of what is going on inside the artist's mind. In this film we see Van Gogh, not just as a troubled soul, but as a sensitive and caring person who never quite found the way to break free of the demons from his past that haunted him up to the end of his life. Barnett's portrayal of Van Gogh is both believable and engaging. Despite the film's length of almost two hours, it holds the viewer's attention and moves the heart.<br />A haunting and emotionally draining experience, but a must see., 6 March 2007<br /><br />Author: jstachelek from United States<br /><br />Having seen some of Barnett's earlier work on stage in N.Y., I was more than familiar with the depth and breadth of his ability as an actor and director; how seemingly effortlessly he brings each of his characters to life. I was fully prepared to be equally moved by his interpretation and portrayal of Vincent van Gogh. I knew that Barnett could be electrifying on stage and I was curious to see how his energy would translate on film.<br /><br />Nothing, however, prepared me for the emotional shock I experienced by his haunting rendering of the most tortured months in the life of van Gogh. The intensity that Barnett brought to this role can only be described as "insane." One can but imagine the years of research and total immersion into the life of van Gogh it must have required to be able to portray with such shocking clarity what was in van Gogh's heart and mind during this brief period of time. Another commenter describes Barnett's performance as, "as close to insanity as you will ever get." I agree.<br /><br />The film is not highly polished in the typical sense. The lighting is poor at times, the sets and scenery drab, and while I know nothing about film editing, I found some of the flashbacks unnecessarily confusing. These perceived flaws could be due to budget constraints, but knowing something of Barnett's work, I tend to think there is some intention on his part. The overall effect is that the viewer experiences the bleakness that is Vincent's life at the time. At times in the film, what is reality and what is only in van Gogh's tortured and clouded mind is as indistinguishable to the viewer as it is to Vincent, making the viewing experience all the more haunting and disquieting. An amazing feat, whether intentional or not.<br />The essence of van Gogh, 27 February 2007<br /><br />Author: paulhodgson-1 from United States<br /><br />The viewer who has not encountered Mr. Barnett's work before may at first feel some disorientation, even shock, at the style and emotional intensity of this award-winning movie. The realization may grow, moving into it minute by minute, that what Barnett has done in his own artistic venue is in many ways comparable to what Vincent did in his -- transforming the artist's own clear perception of reality and life (in this case, Vincent's) into forms strikingly different from any seen in that venue before. This is not the kind of commercialized, mundanely Hollywood-slick film making that we are used to, which I find so often boring, in the end. I'd say to those who would be disappointed by that: look elsewhere.<br /><br />Having had the pleasure of seeing some of Barnett's early work in NY on stage -- Miller and Shakespeare at their best, in my book -- I did not require a period of readjustment of expectation and perception. (At age 33, he did the best King Lear I have ever seen.) What challenged me, in a very positive way, was the complexity and nuance of compressing Vincent's life story, spirit, and values into the remarkably short format of a 111-minute run time. Having known Vincent's story as of decades ago, but not having read the letters of Vincent and Theo, I found it difficult to approach this work with a pristine eye or ear. Would the naive viewer quite understand the context of this or that event (say, the Borinage time), etc? And would the unavoidable constraints of a low budget production detract from the essential experience and value of the work? Impossible for me to know, and anyway, I'm no film critic.<br /><br />I can say that I have it on good authority that the script remains true to the van Gogh letters, and the portrayal certainly remains uniquely true to Vincent's spirit and work. As film making (his first feature work), it uses the full palette, visually and emotionally. My advice: do not view it casually. That would be a waste.<br /><br />Nota Bene: Roy Thinnes is so very Peyron. (I really enjoyed his role in X Files, too.) All said and done -- 9 stars. It will sadden me if we don't see more of Barnett on film, as it does that we don't have some earlier work on film.<br /><br />As close to insanity as you'll ever want to get, 24 February 2007<br /><br />Author: AlwaysRomantic from United States<br /><br />The legend of Van Gogh haunts the ages. What, we wonder, was behind those images. What did Vincent SEE??? The Eyes of Van Gogh will take you there - if you can learn to "paint the air".<br /><br />Van Gogh wanted to push art beyond visual reality. He wanted to paint the air that we could sense but not see. He wanted to paint emotion. But his insanity stole reality from him. He couldn't tell what was real and what was a distortion of real. He fought the distortion with all his strength. He tried to capture reality by surrounding it with color. The distortions fought back, stealing his art equipment, surrounding him with darkness.<br /><br />Alexander Barnett will take you into this fight - I said, take YOU INTO this fight. It's as close to insanity as you'll ever want to get.<br /><br />An intense and haunting portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh as only Barnett can deliver., 11 May 2007<br /><br />Author: p_pellecchia from United States<br /><br />This movie will stir your soul. Barnett draws us in, leaving us emotionally drained, as he brings to life Vincent's struggles and what must have been his tortured state of mind during those dark years. We are immersed into Vincent's mind.<br /><br />Also noteworthy, Roy Thinnes'performance as Dr. Peyron.<br /><br />I thought the sets and costuming were too drab but that did not deter from the, at times, riveting performances on screen.<br /><br />All in all, this is a noteworthy work. Hope to see more of Barnett on film. He comes across as well on film as he does on stage.<br /><br />Would love to see some of his earlier work come alive on the screen.<br /><br />An intimate, but explosive film., 17 November 2007<br /><br />Author: salliejames from France<br /><br />I was truly astonished to see what can be accomplished with a low budget combined with obvious passion and commitment. I have always been a great fan of Roy Thinnes and was delighted to be able to see him again. There have been a couple of films about van Gogh. This one, I believe, captures him more truly and believably than any other I have seen. His torment is palpable and fully understandable. This film is about what happens when extraordinary people are for whatever reason unable to fully realize all of their potential. And yet, despite all, they must persevere. An outstanding performance by Alexander Barnett, who also wrote the screenplay.<br />startling, unflinching, and profound, 30 October 2007<br /><br />Author: graywing4 from United States<br /><br />Mr. Barnett's ability to move us directly into the anguished reality of the genius who was Vincent Van Gogh is startling, unflinching, and profound.<br /><br />He reflects to us the inexorable tragedy brought on by the deeply flawed relationship between the Van Gogh brothers, compounded by the confusion and bitter poverty of being unseen by his peers, misconstrued by the world at large. Yet no one was more in touch with the blazing pulse of creation than this tormented man, whose transcendent work has touched us all.<br /><br />To be confronted with such a life, and such a film, is not for the faint of heart; like Van Gogh's restless and fiery art, Barnett's script is uncomproA superb character study, 29 October 2007<br /><br />Author: klear-1 from United States<br /><br />Before I saw this film, I read about the making of the film and what the director was trying to accomplish. I cannot recall another film about a real person that captured so totally what it might have felt like to be that person and to understand what drove him. I recommend this film to anyone interested in film as an incredible medium for character study. Perhaps this can best, if not only, be accomplished by writer/directors like Ingmar Bergman. In this instance, Alexander Barnett as writer/director/actor has also succeeded beautifully in reincarnating Vincent van Gogh as a being compelled to work, to express himself and his thoughts, to live fully - not as a victim, but heroic in his battle to survive.<br /><br />mising -- and his acting powerful<br />Intense and enlightening, 14 June 2007<br /><br />Author: jlasko from United States<br /><br />Some movies are entertaining. Others are an experience. Alexander Barnett's Van Gogh biopic definitely falls into the latter category. Far from "guilty pleasure" fare, "The Eyes of Van Gogh" is a skillful and passionate portrayal of a talented yet tortured artist. This movie will educate you about the world of this struggling genius, even as it compels you to feel compassion for Van Gogh in his sad state. Competition, debt, insanity, rejection--all of these themes swirl Vincent's reality much like the colors in his paintings...you'll be relieved to view reality for yourself again at the end. But if you let it, the movie may remind you of all you have to be grateful for, and even challenge you to look at your own life through slightly different eyes.
 B000WI23KA, A1IO6CH22LIMT1, James Bond "007", 1/3, 1.0, 1200873600, Dull and unineresting, I took a chance on this low cost download, hoping the low-budget art-house movie would interest my mind and entertain me.<br /><br />First, the digital quality forced me to either sit far back or to shrink the image on my screen.  I've have better image quality with VHS videos.<br /><br />The best attributes of the content were a decent makeup/face of the actor playing the artist, and a plain-looking painted wall in one of the rooms had some 'potential'.  Other than that, there is nothing to interest the viewer visually.  The asylum and people don't look like late 19th Century southern France.  They don't even try to behave, look, or sound French.  Just a little is all that's needed for the viewers imaginations to pick up on something.  No views of the countryside or closeups of anything interesting to set the stage or mood.  Lighting skills were absent.<br /><br />The entire first 20 minutes could have been just a few lines with some emotion and visuals to set the tone, but rather it's an immense amount of words spoken by the actor either to himself or to someone else.  Worse, the words are like they are read from a poorly written book.  No other conflicts, nothing else going on, and simply no theatrical or cinematic 'artistry'.<br /><br />After 20 minutes, I fast forwarded to see if anything else happened different, but was disappointed.<br /><br />I've seen low budget do well before, but this lacks all those little elements that are needed to make it something entertaining.
 B000WI23KA, APV42WWCRYX5U, Seussian Physics, 0/2, 1.0, 1200787200, Terrible., The actor playing Van Gogh has the mannerisms and speech patterns of Woody Allen. It's the worst acting I've ever seen, and there's nothing else to focus on, as the film is nothing but a series of hallucinated conversations interrupted by stuttering, hand-wringing monologues.
 B008FPU7AA, A196IMI8WKWDFK, Vannie Ryanes "Vannie Ryanes/VSR Book Review", 10/10, 2.0, 1034985600, Classic B Movie Fun, One Body Too Many a 1944 black and white movie is not an especially good movie. BUT, it is a fun movie. It is a silly horror/comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios. I love it. Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse. He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler (Bela Lugosi). He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar. However, unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office. Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room. When he does try to get out, he can't open the door, etc. This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable. But that's the fun of it. A huge dark creepy house, a will to be read, a suspicious looking butler and cook, a beautiful damsel in distress, a dim witted detective, a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased, murders, trick doors, screams and noises at night, etc. Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero. This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks timid Jack Haley has something to hide.I have had this movie for years and every once in a while I dust it off to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun.

 B008FPU7AA, A62OMGKSVPZZU, Andrew R. Oerman "A. Rex", 8/8, 3.0, 1006214400, Several Thrills Too Few..., This is yet another of the gathered-for-the-reading-of-the-will-in-the-spooky-house with-secret-passages-and-a-murderer subgenre. And while I find it hard to believe that there is anyone who legitimately can hate these kind of movies, there are admittedly some that work far better than others. One Body Too Many finds middle ground.<p>It begins with some cleverness in setting up the scenario. The will's gimmick is farfetched but assured an offbeat night of criminal mayhem: The deceased, an astrologer, wishes to be buried above ground so that the stars shine down on him. If anything happens so that he is not, then the heir who was supposed to get the most will instead get the least, and vice versa. The body disappears, then reappears, then someone else is murdered... it's all expectedly, even appropriately, convoluted.<p>Our hero is a life insurance salesman who is mistaken for the detective assigned to guard the body from shenanigans. And there is real inventiveness in placing a life insurance salesman in this situation, where people are sure to be bumped off. Unfortunately, this knowing wink to the audience is barely explored at all. The hero himself is an average-looking guy, more likable and less wimpy than many 40's B heroes. And he is surrounded by a capable, if unspectacular, cast.<p>Lugosi is wasted, although his stock Ominous Butler character is interestingly played for laughs this go-round, ready and willing to bump off anybody who anyone else thinks needs bumping off. Watch out for the coffee.<br /><br />This is of course, a comedy/mystery, as every picture in this genre has been since The Cat and the Canary in the 20's. And the comedy is generally the determining factor in how watchable these kind of films are. Here it is not too bad, consisting less of the typical scared mugging and awkward pratfalls than many similar efforts. Only in its dull, protracted middle section does the film lose its way, as the hero gets lost in the ubiquitous secret passageways, caught in a wicker basket with a litter of kittens and wearing only a towel. Don't ask.<p>There are a number of good scenes, including one where the hero, hiding in a coffin, is carried off and dumped in a pool. The movie ends with a suspenseful chase and confrontation atop the observatory. But there is not enough made of the good ideas in the script, and too much damage is done to the whole by the weak or old ideas in the script. You've seen much of it before, so it's not quite worth a purchase. Close but no cigar.<p>See also: The Cat and the Canary; Black Cat (1941); Night Monster; Old Dark House; The Monster Walks; The Gorilla; Seven Keys To Baldpate; The Bat Whispers; and many, many more, if you are so inclined.
 B008FPU7AA, A1J03J0HZ7KU5T, Scott T. Rivers, 2/2, 2.0, 1247875200, Lugosi Steals the Show, "One Body Too Many" (1944) is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast. The "B" programmer remains notable for Bela Lugosi's delightful presence as a coffee-serving butler - the funniest of his red-herring roles. In fact, Bela garners more laughs than Haley's cut-rate version of Bob Hope.
 B008FPU7AA, A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK, Lonnie E. Holder "The Review's the Thing", 2/2, 3.0, 1187395200, What Evil Lurks..., I borrowed my title from "The Shadow."  I have no idea why, but since most of the action in this movie takes place at night, the phrase seemed appropriate.  Anyway, insurance salesman Albert Tuttle (Jack Haley, whose career included the Shirley Temple movies "Poor Little Rich Girl" and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm," and the role of the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz"), arrives at the home of Mr. Cyrus Wentworth, where he is supposed to be selling Mr. Wentworth an insurance policy.  Unfortunately, Mr. Wentworth has already passed away.<br /><br />Mr. Wentworth has specified that certain conditions must be met before his heirs get the goodies.  On the other hand, if the conditions are not met, the terms of his will are to be reversed.  Soon people are dying and disappearing, and Albert Tuttle ends up in a coffin in the pond.  It is mostly in good fun with periodic humor thrown in.  Bela Lugosi lurks about as butler Murkil.  Since I knew of Bela Lugosi's history in horror I kept thinking that Lugosi was the bad guy in this movie.  You will have to watch and see about that.<br /><br />This movie has all the attributes of an Old Dark House type of movie.  There are sinister locations and characters, and murders that seem to have been impossible.  We do not find out who is doing all the deeds until the end of the movie, which is full of action.  This movie is neither the best in this genre nor the worst.  This movie did have some fun moments and I found myself glued to the television while waiting for events to unfold.  Fans of 1940's murder mysteries will find this one to be interesting to watch with several very enjoyable scenes.<br /><br />Enjoy!
 B008FPU7AA, AV6QDP8Q0ONK4, Michael Ledo, 1/1, 5.0, 1330041600, SORRY, I'M A DRIP, When rich man Cyrus J. Rutherford dies all the heirs show up for the reading of a bizarre will. While Cyrus's unique tomb is constructed, the heirs stay in the house. The will insults the heirs, then claims that some will get vasts amounts while others get cab fare. If Cyrus's body is not interned by his wishes then the heirs will swap places, i.e. those that get the most will now get the least. No one knows who is going to get what, they can only guess...or does someone know? Bela plays the butler who tries to give everyone "poisoned" coffee late in the evening, which they all refuse. Jack Haley (The Tin Man) plays an insurance agent who shows up to sell the dead Cyrus a policy, not knowing he is deceased. The guests mistake him for the detective they hired to guard the body.<br /><br />Of course Bela is not the only seemingly trying to knock off heirs...Then there are those who suspect they are the least of the heirs. They want to steal and hide the body so they can get a greater share. Sweet Carol Dunlap (Jean Parker) is suspected of getting the largest share. Lyle Talbot, who starred in so many Ed Wood films is in this one as well as Dorothy Granger from "Death Valley Days."<br /><br />The sound track at times indicates this is a "horror" film while at other times a comedy. It is far from a horror movie. At one point when someone is killed, the suspects are all gathered into one room, as a real who-dun-it murder mystery, except with the comedy of Jack Haley leading the spoof.<br /><br />This is an excellent film which has stood the test of time. The jokes are a bit punny. It is not a blockbuster, but one that certainly can be enjoyed and appreciate by a younger generation. My only negative on this film is that the copy I saw could have used some restoration, especially the sound track.

 B008FPU7AA, A3MV1KKHX51FYT, Acute Observer, 0/0, 3.0, 1227571200, A Murder Mystery Comedy, This film begins at a Life Insurance Company. Eight million dollars was a lot of money then. One agent wants to make a big sale. A lawyer reads the last will for millionaire Cyrus Rutherford. Was he of a sound mind? The heirs will have to live in the house until after the burial. Who will watch the body? Are there too many rats around? "This coffee will not keep you awake." Will the insurance agent be mistaken for a detective? Who will benefit from the will? Who hit Albert? What happened to the body? Does the plot have a clue to the villain? Who will hide the body?<br /><br />Will they find a dead body? The telephone line is also dead. Will Albert be rescued? Is there a secret passage in the old house? Will Albert wander in different rooms? [Does this pad out the story?] "I think I've had enough." "I can explain everything." Will another body be found? Or two? Will the real killer be discovered? Will they all fall into a trap? The last scenes provide an explanation. "Such fine coffee!" [Coffee was rationed during the war.]<br /><br />This film is still entertaining after seven decades. A bigger budget would have made it a better film. But there was war-time rationing for movie sets.
 B008FPU7AA, AIMR915K4YCN, Bindy Sue Frnknschtein "bigfootsalienbaby", 0/0, 3.0, 1112054400, Would You Like Some Coffee?, Albert Tuttle (Jack "Tin Man" Haley) is an eager life insurance salesman on a mission. He's been trying to get an appointment with Cyrus Rutherford, a reclusive, eccentric millionaire for months. Tonight, he's finally done it! Unfortunately, his latest policy prospect has just died, leaving a mansion full of greedy relatives, waiting for their share of the inheritance. Tuttle arrives and is mistaken for a guy who was supposed to guard the old boy's body, so the relatives can sleep without worrying about who might bury uncle Cyrus (a stipulation in the will forbids burial). ONE BODY TOO MANY has plenty of mystery, murders, secret passages, and enough laughs to keep things fun. Jean Parker (Beyond Tomorrow) is the love interest. Bela Lugosi is his normal grumpy self as the butler who is constantly pushing coffee on people that just might be poisoned! Lyle Talbot (Plan 9 From Outer Space, Torture Ship) is suave, dapper, and in constant search of booze. All in all, a good flick for a cold, clammy night...
 B008FPU7AA, A1GWSZ4I2QGCNJ, Laughing Gravy, 1/3, 2.0, 1110844800, Forget a heart, Tin Man, get a script, William Pine and William Thomas were two Paramount executives who joined together to produce some cheap little pictures with Paramount backing and distribution. They became known as the "dollar Bills" for churning out inexpensive pictures that always made money. At first, they specialized in aviation pictures (their first three films were POWER DIVE, FORCED LANDING, and FLYING BLIND, all released in 1941), but when the war began they broadened their screens to include military adventures, mysteries, and even musicals. Like many B outfits they had a stock company of directors (Frank McDonald, William Berke) and players (Richard Arlen, Chester Morris, Roger Pryor and others).<br /><br />Late in the war, Pine-Thomas signed Jack Haley to star in musical-comedies, but the first one, TAKE IT BIG (with Ozzie and Harriet) was a disappointment, so they cast Haley in a mystery-comedy called ONE BODY TOO MANY.<br /><br />Cyrus Wentworth, a crazy multi-millionaire, has died, leaving a will that insults his heirs and promises that half of them will get a lot of money and the other half will get piddle, unless the exact terms of his will aren't carried out, in which case the piddlers will become the piddlees and vice versa. And the terms of his will? He was an astrology nut (who built an observatory atop his decrepit old mansion) and he wants to be entombed with a skylight so he can look up at the stars. Also, everybody named as an heir has to stay in the house for three days until he's safely in his moon-roofed vault. Okay, so you can guess what happens: somebody has read the will, knows he (or she) is a piddlee, and decides to steal the old man's corpse so he can't be entombed, thereby making himself a piddler. Got that? And if anybody gets in his (or her) way, well, then, said anybody is gonna end up vault-shopping with Uncle Cyrus.<br /><br />Okay, you'd think that would be enough plot, but NO! An eager insurance salesman named Tuttle (Jack Haley) shows up; it seems that he had an appointment with the recently deceased to sell him some life insurance (a little late, there, Tuttle). Haley immediately falls in love with one of the old boy's relatives, the delicious Jean Parker, and decides to stay and protect her. The problem is, he spends the rest of the film cowering, running, hiding, and in general doing everything he can to not impress her. Bob Hope he ain't. Funny he ain't, either. Neither?<br /><br />Okay, lastly I will mention that there is a creepy butler and housekeeper (naturally), the former of whom is Bela Lugosi in a throw-away part. We see him getting a bottle of rat poison off the shelf ("Dere are too many rats in dis houssssse... dey should be done avay vith!") and then spending the rest of the film offering coffee to the assembled, with a look of chagrin when they all refuse (or what passes for chagrin on Lugosi's mug; it could've also been anger, humor, annoyance, horniness, or impatience that his giant bats hadn't arrived yet).<br /><br />ONE BODY TOO MANY is one Jack Haley scare comedy too many. The Alpha DVD is okay, though, if you're gonna take the plunge anyway.
 0790747324, AEXTGSES7BVSV, "trucky1958", 1/1, 5.0, 992044800, The Time Machine, I used to watch The Time Machine in black and white TV when I was little child.  I did not understand what they said because of my deafness.  Now I just loved it in color and even closed-captioned in an excellent condition.  I just prefer to get the closed-captioned video tapes so we could enjoy to watch them.
 0790747324, A324LH8S4C8U4W, Kevin Nieman "Writer / Provocateur", 1/1, 5.0, 987638400, This Was Vicarious Fantasy Like No Other Film of its Kind., My dear, dear friend, &quot;time-lapse photography,&quot; introduced itself to me in &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; and I was forever changed. It showed me worlds I had not seen, at least, not in a fantastical sense. As a boy in the Seventies, I was not able to see this film in the theater, but the impact it made on me was equal to a nuclear explosion. The giddy feeling of following the intrepid time traveller through the ages was like climbing Everest for the first time, or stepping foot on the Moon. That may be hyperbole, but the thrill of seeing a lit candle melt quickly down to the candlestick in seconds was palpable. Electric. Captivating. I absorbed every image, every sound, and I was there with Rod Taylor every step of the way. It was an exhilerating ride, and it's one I highly recommend that you take. I hope that the ride is as thrilling for you as it was for me.
 0790747324, A96DHMTN072M1, James M. Cargal, 1/1, 5.0, 968457600, An Enduring Classic, By today's standards this movie might be weak.  The special effects are  primitive and it is not pushing H. G. Well's point.  Nonetheless, I have  watched this movie everytime it has appeared on t.v.  It has a certain  charm and innocence, not to mention that Rod Taylor derserved more work as  a leading man.  Maybe it is my &quot;guilty pleasure,&quot; but this movie  never grows tiresome. I recommend this movie to any sic-fi fan (and to  everyone else!).
 0790747324, A1L7G9JSLCY384, David Crosby, 1/1, 5.0, 962409600, The all TIME classic adventure, This film ranks as quite literaly my all time favorite.  It has everything in it:  Great sets, great actors, an H G Wells storyline, time travel, monsters, Yvette, the lot.  I first watched this movie on a Halloween night  on TV many years ago and just fell in love with it.  This viewing was years  before video became available so all I could look for was a sountrack album  to the terrific Garcia score.  Nope, it didn't exist.  Then along came  video.  I waited for years before it came out.  In all of that time it had  not been re-screened on UK TV so I was watching it again with nothing short  of a childhood memory that could have been devastated after so many years.  This was not to be the case.  It was still as good, if not better (as I had  since read the novel, read up on Pal and knew a lot more about the movie)  than it was when I first saw it.  My wife kind of wishes that I did not  like it so much as she finds the poster creepy (see front cover of DVD -  this was not used on the previous VHS versions) and I had hunted high and  low to obtain an original cinema poster which now hangs in our study.  I am  very pleased to see that MGM are tagging on the more recent documentary  that was released seperately over here but was so limited in its  distribution that I did not get a copy.  It features Rod recreating the  role of the Time Traveller (so I believe), some dialogue and behind the  scenes stuff.  I can only say that I was excited when Amazon sent the email  informing me that the movie was on its way and I ordered one right away.  If you've seen this movie and liked it, I believe that DVD will serve it  well.  If you have not seen this movie, don't let the fact that it was made  in 1960 put you off.  It is a vibrant, action packed spectacular that all  should see.  Thank you MGM for issuing this classic.
 0790747324, A1ZPC1MHSY1RUY, Christopher Pataky "History buf", 3/4, 5.0, 1173312000, A Great look at Movie History, It was a great book and although this movie is a bit different from the original book, the movie gives us a great look at the view of the future in the 1960's.  Obviously H. G. Well could not imagine a nuclear holocaust to destroy what we know of civilization, but it is a better explanation then what the book gives us and is easier to relate to.  H. G. Wells was trying to show us the downfall of civilization through industrialization, and the movie shows us the modern problem of the 1960's.
 0790747324, A3BSL4PQKPH3SQ, Guri Harari, 3/4, 5.0, 1107993600, A true work of art., The original short novel by H.G. Wells, "The Time Machine", was not written with movie theatres in mind. Wells' masterpiece is a grim and thoughtful social satire - a genre which works well as a piece of literature, but would really stink as a 2-hour feature film... Only a genius could use this raw material to create a decent sci-fi film: The genius of film Director George Pal.<br /><br />The film is enjoyable. It creates a sense of awe and wonder. It includes enough original material to make the film interesting, yet captures just enough of H.G. Wells original tale to be considered a faithful adaptation. What more do you need?
 0790747324, A2IMHV5ZARXIDR, Joseph R. Kamps, 3/4, 5.0, 1028332800, Much better than the Remake, I watched the remake of the Time Machine and expected it to be awesome.  It wasn't awesome, but it was ok.  The special effects were really cool and all, but the story itself seemed to move too fast.  I then went and rented the original Time Machine.  I liked the original far more than the remake.  The scientist narrarates the whole movie and the story is so much better.  I will admit--the special effects were cheesy, but what can you expect??This movie was made in 1960!!  If you want to see a great movie that has mystery, horror, action, and suspense, this is the one to buy.  I reccommend this highly to everyone!!
 0790747324, A25JH6CO4DVINS, Junglies, 5/7, 4.0, 1017792000, Take me back!, The sight of Jeremy Irons as the Morlock leader was enough to drive me to the local video store to buy this mid-priced selection.<p>While the new version of the H. G. Wells novel plays to the contemporary youth market with the emphasis on the special effects to create the Wellsian idyll and the deformities of the Warlocks, it does miss the point a little.<p>This, the original, won an Oscar for the special effects and given the technology of the day it was clearly well deserved. The movie itself set the tone for science fiction movies too with it's original setting and the ability to show the passage of time through several devices such as the circulating sun and the tailors dummy.<p>It is the conception of the novel however, which for me emphasises the differences between this movie and the newer version. The central difference lies in the somewhat ordinariness of the society of the Eloi. They are living a simple, almost idyllic lifestyle, knowing nothing much about the world around them except what they need to know. They live in ruins with food and clothing provided for them. In the newer version there is some complex structures which do not make a whole lot of sense as they are still susceptible to raids from the Morlocks.<p>The Eloi suggest a socialist society where each according to ability each according to need whereas the Morlocks represent the evils of the capitalist machine. In the end of course, the victory over the Morlocks is achieved with the aid of our hero who's single minded devotion to rescuing the heroine culminates in defeat of the capitalist machine.<p>Thus the original time machine remains as true to the concept of the novel as perhaps it can be whereas the message of the new is obscured.<p>Certainly the original Time Machine is a little dated but it is worth it.
 0790747324, A2YD21XOPJ966C, C. Freeman, 5/7, 5.0, 1015545600, The One, Only, and Future 'Time Machine', I've become a bit of a skeptic, and even more of a cynic over the years whenever I hear of a major production company doing a remake of an original movie. I've come to realize that 'remakes' rarely live up to the original, except perhaps in special effects (which they often surpass). But special effects does not a classic make, unless that's all you look for in a movie. I have no doubt that the 2002 release of 'The Time Machine' will trounce the original in this department, but everything else being equal, I doubt it will become a classic, as this movie has.<p>Having said that I must say the original 'Time Machine' is perhaps one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies of all time. What makes this movie special is the great attention to plot and characterization, as well as keeping scrupulously to the H.G. Wells novel, both in content and in characterization. By contrast I've heard that the remake was quite revisionary. <p>Rod Taylor does a splendid job in portraying the inventor with a consciense, the man who must wrestle with questions that have no easy answers. The viewer can sympathize with his predicament of using his invention for the betterment - or detriment - of mankind, no easy task since he is surrounded by friends who can only think in terms of the material. <p>At the core of this movie is his friendship with David, played splendidly by Alan Young (Mr. Ed). One of the most noticeable things about this film is the commaraderie between these two men, as well as their differences: George, the idealist, and David, the pragmatic. Yet in SPITE of the differences, their friendship endures. This is especially seen in 'Time Machine: The Journey Back' a sequel (or followup) to the original movie and which is featured on the DVD. <p>The music score by Russell Garcia is another factor that makes this movie so special. It fits perfectly into each scene so seamlessly that you can't imagine another music score for this film.<p>In closing, the remake my be more exciting to watch, but I doubt if it will be as thought-provoking as the original, which in my opinion is the one, only, and future 'Time Machine'.
 0790747324, A1JY13815273PS, Robert L. Wehrle, 4/6, 5.0, 1102982400, A Classic with some cool extras, Simply one of the most entertaining films of all time.  Great special effects...remember when people built stuff out of real things and had to suspend your disbelief without crappy ass flimsy transparent souless computer graphics?  I'm telling you man, the entrance to the Morlock Caves exists...a truly resourceful ingenius use of special effects for its time!  As a young lad I watched this movie countless times.  Dad's, get this movie for your adolescent son.  He will love it.  I've never seen the remake...I'm sure it sucks for air.  The music is fantastic and is half the experience.  George Pal predicted the moptop haircut with the Eloi actors only a couple years before the British Invasion.  The extras are actually worth watching with an added scene made quite a few years later...highly amusing.  And it's got Mr. Ed's owner in it and he's a superb actor...now c'mon!  Get the credit card out!  And then there's the part when he spins the talking coins and they tell of the recent past.  And  there's the part with the nuclear bomb and the lava and then he sets fire to a Morlock and he explodes and then and then and then....it's awesome.
 0790747324, A18L8A19V8XHRF, C. Thormann, 2/3, 5.0, 1202428800, The Time Machine, What a difference watching this dvd compared to watching it on vhs. The picture is so clear!  Lots of extras at the end. This is a great movie, watch it several times a year and never get tried of it.
 0790747324, A642JVHMR691N, Take Stock "Sharon", 2/3, 4.0, 1163635200, A Safe Sci-Fi, This is one to watch if you like sci-fi films, but don't like a grotesque, horror flick. The plot is built around the traditional good versus evil with good triumphing.
 0790747324, A1IR2GGUJUELG0, Sableknight, 2/3, 4.0, 1155600000, Classic, This movie is one of the better quality movies from the 60's.  With very little special effects the story line is great.  The warning of what faces the world if we don't change our ways is played out very will here.  Excellent actors in Rod Taylor and Alan Young.
 0790747324, A2H22I2RWE0HOV, Mr. Sinister, 2/3, 5.0, 1130803200, A Timeless Classic!  Groundbreaking Visual Effects, Geroge Pal, with his groundbreaking visual-effects and his eye for detail add a sharpness to this classic telling of H.G. Wells famous story.  Rod Taylor's performance is over-the-top at times (as is he were channeling Charleton Heston at times) but otherwise straight-forward and charming.  The Morlocks vs. The Eloi...Hmmmm.  Interesting stuff.  After taking his time going into the future, first stop in the 40's, second the 60's  and then .... on to 802701.  Civilization is in ancient ruins .... technology seems to have expired.  Here are the Eloi, a group of futuristic nymphs and idiots dressed in skimpy pastel togas singing and staring and giggling like cretins.  Life is simple...as George the Time Traveler learns when one of the pretty little nymphettes starts to drown in the river and no one rushes to her aid.  Enter hero George... he soon discovers that there's something sinister in this braindead paradise...enter the Morlocks.  The Morlocks are a group of critters that used to be human thousands and thousands of years ago but were transformed when they fled the surface of the planet (probably because of the implied nuclear halocaust) to dwell in the darkness.  Glowing eyes, blue-green skin, blond fur running down the top of both arms...these creeps mean business.  A siren starts to wail and the Eloi start marching like mesmerized lemmings to a cliff...into the underground.  For...here's the kicker...the Eloi are the Morlock's food supply.  Can you say cannibalism?  I knew you could.  Overall, this 1960 classic can't be denied its rightful place in film history.  Looking back the effects pale in the light of CGI, but they were more pure back then, more real, and people like George Pal paved the way for the things possible today.  This is a great movie!  Be not afraid...far, far superior to the remake.<br /><br />Dig it!
 0790747324, A3W06CKKUVIAIY, Manuel Mendez, 2/3, 4.0, 1126224000, Classic, This film has become a fiction classic. Based in an other classic fiction writer, H.G. Wells. A must seen film for all fiction lovers
 0790747324, A286G67EK7Q1WD, Manuel Antonio Diaz Teres "m_diazt", 2/3, 5.0, 1112572800, Extraordinary movie, When I first saw this movie I was only 8. I saw it on TV and -due to the TV set-in B & W not it color. However it had a great impact on me because of the incredible and magical special effects. For a small boy years away from the computers enviroment this was the very best movie of all...and it still is.<br /><br />I wonder why George Pal never become such a great entrepreneur as Walt Disney. Obviously the both had a special gift and used it to bring their imagination close to the public mainly through motion pictures.<br /><br />And in speaking of pictures, Pal and Disney established their own landmarks, from my point of view, with "The Time Machine" and "20,000 Leagues under the Sea" respectively.<br /><br />"The Time Machine" may seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI top ranking: it makes you believe for a moment it's possible to travel through time.
 0790747324, A3JPPR6JT75N0E, Rob "Coolerking", 2/3, 5.0, 1108598400, Once Upon a Wondrous Time..., Every viewing of The Time Machine takes me back to the wonders of childhood: bubblegum trading cards, comic books, and George Pal movies. The early sixties was a great time to be a kid. With other classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth to entertain our eager young minds, our eyes frequently popped at the terrific adventures we witnessed onscreen. The Time Machine endures as great cinematic storytelling.<br /><br />When I was little, the movie scared me. Remember, the atomic attack comes in 1966, which was still the future for us then. My favorite part has always been when George fast-forwards in his lab. However, that gave me some anxiety at the time because it disturbed me that he was leaving home and maybe never coming back. I thought the Morlocks were great monsters and seem to recall my friends and I dividing up between Morlocks and Eloi for some play fighting later. Of course it was more fun to be a Morlock than an Eloi. But if you got to be Rod Taylor, then you had ARRIVED.<br /><br />One of the interesting things I noted on my last viewing was the technology. 80.000 years into the future, what remains of knowledge is stored on old "rings" that spin to speak. I turned and looked at my ten-year-old son and said, "That could be cds!"<br /><br />Round, shiny discs that play an audio recording when spinning-sounds just like a cd to me. Even in 1960, this was amazingly prophetic. Also, I mentioned how great it would be to have a replica of the time machine. Then, "our host", Robert Osbourne remarked as to how the prop had become lost and then years later bought at a THRIFT STORE! Just imagine that lucky son-of-a-gun.<br /><br />It's a shame that we've grown to a time when special effects take precedent over character and story. Fortunately, an occassional film comes forward with both (like LOTR) but the newer Time Machine is not one of these. Rod Taylor and George Pal's version is the one to see. Made in the midst of the Cold War, it's a question of where are we going as a species: annihilation or ascension. Ultimately, it is an optimistic piece about the noble possibilities that endure despite neverending conflicts inherent in the human experience. Every generation has its Morlocks, and our choice remains: Are we Rod Taylor or an Eloi?

Wells Classic story is done Proud!!!!!, I cannot say how faithful this movie is to the book, however it is an outstanding science fiction movie.  The cinematic techniques available for this movie are not as garish as you might see today, but are nonetheless very effective in supporting the cracking screenplay.  Rod Taylor's potrayal of Wells is spot on and deserving of special note.  The sets are also exceptional with the period furniture and architecture very well done.  It is a classic story well adapted to the screen.  I recommend this movie to all true science fiction and Time travel fans.
 0790747324, A9UU8OR0TBMHE, Alexander Nordquist, 2/3, 5.0, 1061596800, A Great Sci-fi Classic!!!, The Time Machine is one of the best science fiction films made and it has always been one of my favorites! The first time I watched this was when I was in the first grade. The movie is about an inventor named George[Rod Taylor] who has greated a time machine and goes on a journey into the year 802701.<p>  The movie starts out when you see David Filby[one of George's friends] walking up to George's house where you see some more of his friends. Then eventually you see George but he's been beaten up because he has gone on a long journey. Then he talks about the story.<p>  In the next part, George is showing his friends the tiny model of his time machine and he want's to proove that time travel really exists. But, when his friends don't believe him he decides to go on the long journey.<p>  Then you see George going through many different time periods into he finally gets to the year 802701. Instead of having a lot of technology it's just an area of grass. There are a group of people there named the Eloi and they obey a group of monsters called morlocks. The morlocks give the Eloi their food, clothing and in the end they take them underground and kill them. So then George meets one of the girls named Weena when she is just about to drown but luckily George saves her. But, soon George gets mad when he finds out that the Eloi don't work very much and they mostly just play, so he goes back to his machine. But, thats when the trouble begins. The morlocks have stolen his machine! They grabbed it and put it in their secret place. So, the only thing left to do is go to the underground area, kill the morlocks, save the eloi and get his machine back and that mostly takes you to the end where George gets his machine back and luckily travels back to his own time.<p>  When George finishes telling them the story they think it is silly but when George shows David the flower that Weena gave to him he starts to change his opinion.<p>  In the end George takes a few books with him and travels back to 802701 to see the eloi again.<p>  The special features include: Behind the scenes documentary time machine: the journey back, hosted by Rod Taylor and featuring Alan Young, Whit Bissel and others involved in the film soundtrack remastered in dolby digital 5.1. Interactive Menus Theatrical Trailer, Filmogaphies of Tayor, Yvette Mimieux, Young and George Pal scene access, languages and subtitles in english and francais.<p>  I loved every single part of this movie all the way through, the story is just amazing!!<p>  This is a sci-fi classic everyone should own!!!

What would you do in the actor's shoes?. I only wish I had a machine like that....... Overall: EXCELLENT. By the way, the new version on this movie is a joke. This is the one to watch.
 0790747324, A3HPOCPJJQNMWN, SS-3, 2/3, 5.0, 994204800, A Classic that has held up well over time!, I used to watch this movie on ABC afternoon theater after school in the `70s. I always felt it was the best time travel movie. Having seen more recent and modern time travel movies I must admit that this one is still the best. The extras on the DVD are insightful and interesting and the movie itself has never looked better. Any Sci-Fi fan or HG Wells fan will love this movie.
 0790747324, A22IK3I6U76GX0, Calle, 2/3, 5.0, 977875200, A great, very entertaining movie!, This movie is very entertaining. An inventor has constructed a time machine in the end of the 19th century. His friends don't believe it's true, even when he shows them a small size model. The last day of the century, he tests the time machine. He makes a first stop in 1917 (It's quite illogic here, that nobody has during all the years, walked up to his laboratory to look for him and found the time machine). He continues his journey through time and experiences the ruin of the civilization from a nuclear bomb. He ends up in about 80,000 years into the future. He finds a new civilization which, at first sight, seems to be a paradise. But he realizes something is wrong. He has to help the people, who are everything but driven to change their situation.<p>The Time Machine is a very good movie. It's a great story, good actors, scenery, and Academy Award winning special effects. The time machine looks really cool.

 0790747324, AGG9653C0BX5Y, T. Munro, 0/0, 5.0, 1350345600, A great sci-fi classic, If you're watching this, then you know what you're getting into. This is one of the top sci-fi/fantasy movies of the era alongside "War of the Worlds," and "The Day The Earth Stood Still."  A terrific yarn, very well acted and (for the time) great special effects. The transfer to DVD brings out the colors and clarity of the movie.<br /><br />If you're a fan of 50's-60's science fiction/fantasy, then this needs to be in your collection.

Given the age of the movie (1960) I didn't know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - the acting, the sets, and the story itself.  Obviously there are a few parts that are comically terrible given what we're accustomed to in sci-fi and CGI today.  But they don't really detract from the overall experience, and the parts that are done well are simply excellent.  Recommended.

 0790747324, A2ULZL8DI2G7P, Princeeverlove, 0/0, 5.0, 1348358400, TRAVEL THROUGH TIME ONCE AGAIN!, George Pal's 1960 Masterpiece of Sci~Fi/Fantasy is a delight to the eyes and ears. Spectacular colors, costumes,sets and music combine to make the Best Movie in my opinion of this genre of the early 60's. You have time travel,history lessons,girl in distress,and evil monsters.Perfect. Alongside "Forbidden Planet" and "Robinson Crusoe On Mars",this is in my Top 3 Favorite Sci~Fi Films ever!

The other one being Mysterious Island. I had problems with the sound and the actors not being in sync with what they were saying. Maybe it was just my computer but it was a problem.
 0790747324, A3MSH2YW203752, Leo Hott, 0/0, 5.0, 1345507200, classics on dvd, I heard some bad reviews on the quality of transfer but I thought It was just fine the colors werent as vibrant as the VHS I was replaceing but some people may like the colors more toned down. personally I thought It was well worth the price I paid & liked it better than the remake.
 0790747324, AB6XFM6GDGCOZ, Randall Riley "The Swing Shift", 0/0, 5.0, 1345420800, Great, Classic Science Fiction, Others have said it better so I'll keep my review brief. The restoration work on this film is excellent: great sound, colors bright and sharp. DVD plays perfectly and there is a bonus on here of a documentary about the restoration of said machine, hosted by Rod Taylor, who is reunited with his old friend, Alan Young. They even do a short skit where Taylor attempts to rescue Alan Young's character from his date with destiny (tries to stop him from leaving for France, where he was killed in WWI), which gives fans of this great film one extra moment with the Time Machine cast members. I recommend the DVD to anyone who loves this great H.G. Wells story.
 0790747324, A2FFYQZPUGOX58, Magnifying Glass, 0/0, 5.0, 1344988800, 8028th Century, If you are H. George Wells, you long to live in a time without war.  Perhaps that is what drives your obsession with time, the devices that measure it, and the desire, above all, to invent a machine that will allow you to zip through the centuries to a more peaceful and saner era. . . .<br /><br />Tucked away in your solarium, you have crafted such a device.  At first glance, one might think it was a one-man sleigh, with bent brass bars, a red-velvet chair, and a large odd-looking concave copper disk just aft of the traveller's seat.  When the disc spins, the encoding on its rim ( 1 4 2 3 1 4 5 1 etc. ) activates the machine like the prongs on a music box; the faster it spins, the faster it moves through time.<br /><br />You take a seat.  The controls are simple.  Firstly, you activate the display circuits; the switches are on top of the control cylinder in front of you:  yellow is for the "days" indicator, green for "months", and red for "years."  Secondly, you reach down underneath the cylinder and switch on the machine's motive power.<br /><br />To the right of the display is a polished green-mineral lever topped with a faceted quartz knob.  You push the lever upward, the disc spins, the display flutters future dates, but on each stop in the 20th century you find war; you push the lever to its max.<br /><br />When you stop, you find what you were looking for:  a society that is at peace, no war, but when night comes, you discover that fear rules, and in the day, when the siren calls ... well, the attrition of the flocks of humanity goes on, even in the 8028th century. . . .<br /><br />Picture (DVD): 3.5.  Measured Aspect Ratio as:  1.78:1.
 0790747324, A1SMO511H9HDXL, jeffer, 0/0, 5.0, 1344643200, Great Movie, I recently bought this movie on Amazon and just finished watching it.  This movie was better than many new movies that cost two or three times as much.  Though this movie was created a long time ago, nothing in it seems to be dated in a manner that lessens my enjoyment.<br /><br />The plot was very good in my opinion.  It is based a written story by HG Wells who is known as the "Father of Science Fiction".  For people who are not big science fiction lovers, this movie should still be a good movie, because it doesn't go overboard with discussion and narration about technical details like many science fiction books/movies.  Wells was very skilled in writing in many other genres, so the movie is focused more on George and the people around him than objects/props and technology itself.<br /><br />I will eventually watch this movie again.

 0790747324, A27W5AJNP6YX7Z, Ivy Bewley "Hiedra", 0/0, 4.0, 1338336000, Excellent science-fiction, Time travel has always fascinated me, and of course The Time Machine is the most basic time travel movie ever, right? I've never had a chance to read the book, but I found this an excellent film whose special effects stand up well to the test of time. Today's digital age can make flowers bloom and snails race across the floor more realistically, but the scenes of the sun flying across the sky, for example, were great. And the real beauty of the movie was the story and the message behind it.<br /><br />It's hard to judge anything that might happen 800,000 years into the future. Progressive authors have made some interesting predictions in the past (look at the awesome flat-screen TVs in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087F6L">Fahrenheit 451</a>!). This story - and nothing we currently know, I imagine, will still be remembered in 800,000 years. H.G. Wells's predictions will not be judged. But in the meantime, it was still an incredibly fun story.<br /><br />The only thing I found disturbing was that the Eloi came across so heartless. They were on the surface a peaceful people, but didn't have any attachments to each other. They were unconcerned when they lost members of their own families. Even in 800,000 years, I don't really buy that people would evolve to that point.
 0790747324, A284JHTBVKHSQ8, hound 1, 0/0, 4.0, 1337385600, Still enjoy watching., Watching older movies, such as this one, can be quite enjoyable. There is no reliance on special effects, just what is needed to get to points. Otherwise this is a people movie commenting on Welles' vision of what may be. Rod Taylor plays his part well and for once was not the cavalier playboy as in others.  A nice piece was the featurette that included an updated visit of Welles and his friend. Nothing fancy, good watching.

I've watched this movie "Time Machine" when I was little in the 60's, It was the greatest. Hey! in those days they did what they can as a youngster to scare the witts out of you, but today's movie technology is even scarier. For me I like the old sc-fi, simlpe and fun to watch all over again. See you in the future.
 0790747324, A1A7YFVQXXN94, K. Nichols, 0/0, 5.0, 1328054400, Great gift!, I purchased this as a surprise gift for my husband who loves older Sci-Fi movies and he loves it!  He knew of the movie but had forgotten about it.  This was not a title he had on his 'wish list' but when I was buying another movie for him I noticed that others had purchased this one as well.  (Great strategy Amazon!  Putting those suggestions on the page works!) I took a chance on this purchase & I want to say "Thanks" to the other Sci-Fi fans out there who helped me surprise him.  Ok...so I can't really write a review of the movie because I fell asleep watching it.  Sorry fans!  I'm sure if you enjoy this era of movies, you will enjoy this movie as well.

I like the scene where there is a flat screen tv in the background when the time traveler comes to 1966 and a little girl drops her Woody Woodpecker doll.  Great plot and an all out great movie!
 0790747324, AXVTC1NCLZI7P, TORTmentor, 0/0, 5.0, 1325030400, Classic Sci-Fi!, "The Time Machine" is an all-time favorite of ours.  Ranks up top with "Forbidden Planet" and "The Thing (original)"  Please note that on Instant Video the co-star Yvette Mimieux is not credited correctly...they have another Yvette listed.
 0790747324, A2XD1IYPRTS0O5, Joel Kovacik, 0/0, 5.0, 1324425600, A Film To Cherish Throughout Time!, THE TIME MACHINE is a heartwarming sci-fi adventure film which I can watch for the umpteenth time on a Monday, then get ready to sit down on Tuesday and eagerly watch it all over again.<br /><br />Preposterous as time travel may seem to the three-dimensional mind, the idea has doubtless captivated the imagination of everyone at least once during his life. My own wondrous "journey into the future" via this spellbinding film began when I was a teenager back in the early 60s, and I have returned countless times to the gentle Eloi and cannibalistic Morlocks with that same renewed sense of dazzled expectation I experienced on previous occasions.<br /><br />This is a film that truly delivers.  The special effects are outstanding...the acting superb...the drama riveting!<br /><br />Rod Taylor, as the inventor of the time machine, is relentlessly -- believably! -- heroic in the role of H. G. Wells; Yvette Mimieux -- with one of the most crushingly beautiful faces ever to appear on earth -- is unforgettable as the innocent Weena; Alan Young's sensitive portrayal of David Filby (the only one of Wells' friends wise and compassionate enough to lend support to Wells' "outlandish" theories) makes a lasting impression on the viewer.<br /><br />And one of the major, not-to-be-overlooked highlights of this endearing film is the evocative musical score provided by Russell Garcia, which I'm listening to now as I write this review. The sweeping main theme pulls you right into the drama, while the "London" theme tugs gently at the heartstrings. (There's one gorgeous passage here that's straight out of Debussy.  Has anyone made note of it?)<br /><br />Don't miss THE TIME MACHINE for the world, and give yourself the chance to see what great filmmaking was capable of creating 50 long years ago.

This is really well done, with fine special effects, and good acting. No, it's not Jimmy Stewart and Betty Davis quality, but what is?<br /><br />This is the iconic 'Time Machine' movie. The one all the others hope to be.
 0790747324, A3IZ8I22Q11JOZ, bigD, 0/0, 5.0, 1303862400, The Time Machine, I have been looking for this original H. G. Wells classic with Rod Taylor and Alan Young for quite a while. Watched it as soon as it arrived and I wasn't disappointed!! It's a great film, I would recommend it to everyone.
 0790747324, A1GB0HW46Y2EB, Bruce G. Taylor, 0/0, 4.0, 1282003200, Time Machine Still Ticking, After all these years, "The Time Machine" (1960) remains a very entertaining movie.  Of the five or six films produced by George Pal, "The Time Machine", which was also directed by him, along with "The War of the Worlds" (1953) are probably his finest films.  Both films are loosely based on the novels of H.G. Wells and, for their time, boasted state of the art special effects, for which both films won an Oscar.<br /><br />Rod Taylor is the lead character, supposedly H.G. Wells himself, who claims to his friends to have invented a time machine, allowing him to travel back and forth in time.  His brief discussion with his friends, attempting to explain the principles of time travel, similar to the Wells novel, makes it seem almost plausible until one thinks about it a little longer.  Taylor,  whose British accent slowly fades away as the picture goes on, plays his character earnestly and is surrounded by an able cast:  Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, Whit Bissell, Yvette Mimieux, Doris LLoyd, very likable as his house maid, and, in particular, Alan Young, who delivers a perfect Scottish accent, as his devoted but practical-minded Scottish friend.  Why not? Alan Young grew up in Edinburgh.<br /><br />The special effects for this film are basically simple but effective, using time-lapse photography to simulate the acceleration of events that one would supposedly witness if he were rapidly moving forward in time.  His journey, after a few brief stops to observe the two World Wars and a nuclear attack pointedly set in the mid 1960s, ultimately takes him several hundred thousand years into the future in which he encounters a race of "beautiful people", the Eloi and a race of barbarous beings called the Morlocks who are (literally) living off the Eloi.  At this point the screen play of the picture and the novel of H.G. Wells part company, the movie pretty much resorting to melodramatic action for its resolution.<br /><br />The video quality of the DVD is very good and the sound recording, as a pleasant surprise, is in genuine and high quality stereophonic sound although it was never presented that way in any theater in which I saw this film.  The music is a rich orchestral score by Russ Garcia and adds a good deal to the effectiveness of the film.<br /><br />I thinks it's safe to say that this film version of the Wells novel, with all of its shortcomings, still betters the 2002 remake in spite of the technical superiority of the newer film.  Alan Young makes a brief but welcome cameo appearance in the 2002 film which, unfortunately, fails to convey the atmosphere of H.G. Wells that the older film, at least in places, manages to accomplish,
 0790747324, A3E0UE5XMWT5IS, Catwoman59 "Sue", 0/0, 5.0, 1276128000, A blast from the past, for the future!, I remember seeing and being fascinated by this movie as a youngster and while the special effects are obviously dated, it's still a favorite. Make sure you check out the Special Features and see the segment hosted by a much older and stouter Rod Taylor, telling how the Time Machine itself was made, how it survived the years in spite of finally being found in a thrift shop (!), was restored and was used in the 'Back to the Future' movies, among other video clips. His touching tribute to George Pal, the movie's producer, is very moving.<br /><br />No, this doesn't follow the original storyline entirely but it's a wonderful adventure nonetheless.

 0790747324, A2AIOLDNAA6742, D. Faber, 0/0, 5.0, 1254355200, A classic, The movie is one of the all time Sci-Fi classics. By today's special effects standards, it doesn't hold a candle, but that really doesn't make any difference because the story is timeless and for the time it was made, the effects are pretty impressive. I remember seeing The Time Machine in the theater as a kid and I've watched it many times since then. When I saw that I could own a NEW DVD of the movie I jumped at the chance. Especially interesting and entertaining is the "new" scene they've put into the special features.

 0790747324, A2U0ABMZK6XBVF, Richard A. Tucker "Tucker at large", 0/0, 4.0, 1246924800, Better with age, When I was a kid I can't recall how many times I watched this film on the television, but it was always among my favorites. It still is.<br />What's great about getting older is how your experiences can actually improve on something that's already among your favorites. Sadly, it also diminishes some of the things you thought you liked.<br />Everything about this film now has the weight of emotional maturity working for it. Today the emotional punch of a man saying goodbye to his world, even for what he thought was a brief trip, holds a lot more poignancy now then it did back then. That's especially the case for the one friend who holds out on the hope of your return despite the unlikliness of such an event. This film opens with a restless man stuck in an age, his age, where he despises man's futility but accepts that life amicably enough.<br />It ends in a similar manner but now that man holds a sense of purpose, a goal he has set and will fulfill to the best of his ability. He starts with curiosity and ends with a motive.<br />The FX of this film are dated. They have to be. But the story itself is timeless. Forgive the pun.<br />The one disappointment is the battle towards the end. The Morlocks are not as scary as before. They're just as vile, but pathetic. I also wish George Pal had insisted on a scene from the book where the time traveller sees the future after the Morlock time when the sun is dimming.<br />Anyway, this has worn very well with age.

He attempts to prevent her death many times, but she dies anyway despite his efforts under different circumstances - "one cannot prevent fate"?<br /><br />Rod Taylor does a supurb job as the curious scientist, moving into future time, as we see 1960 special effects of fashion changes, and the creation of the horseless carriage. He moves forward with great pace as the earth is destroyed by man. Thousands of years pass, as the rocks of centuies finally disapate to find himself in a kind of paradise, where berry's are the size of soccer balls.<br /><br />Later we find the earth is divided into two types: Eloi & Morlock. The dominant class, (Morlock) and the slave class, (Eloi) as the Morlock's supply the basics of life for the apathetic Eloi, only to exploit them for their own ends. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />Here comes the protaganist to save the day, going back in time to tell his story to his colleagues.<br /><br />The protaganist goes forward in time to create a "new way of life" for the Eloi, however, he only takes one book with him, and the audience is left wondering what book it could be.<br /><br />If you were in the same situation, what one book would you take forward in time to create a new civilization?<br /><br />A favourite as a child, (book & novel) this film has always continued to be food for thought and a personal sentimental classic.<br /><br />A film to have in one's library.
 0790747324, AD0J5KK4WQXNS, OverTheMoon, 0/0, 4.0, 1231286400, Weeennnaaa!, The Time Machine is great although maybe for different reasons now compared to when it was first released in the 60s, the special effects have not stood the test of time very well, but because it doesn't take itself too seriously there is much fun to be had watching blue bodybuilders wearing mops on their heads, a lava destruction sequence that was done filmed with your basement train set and hot jam and where the harebrained futuristic people are all blonde!, all makes the Time Machine a must see and eons better than its remake.<br /><br />Before the turn of the 20th century George Wells builds a time machine and instead of going into the past decides to visit the future. His journey leads him to meet with children of his friends from the past, multiple world wars and a future society where humanity has speciated into two opposing groups. Can George prove it all happened and can his machine change fate? If you like any sort of corny classic film then The Time Machine is a whole bag of that and then some more. It might not have heavy duty thinking behind it like Forbidden Planet, and watches much like an extended episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, but at the same time is its own film in its own unique way. Just see if you can say that girl's name and keep a straight face. Weeennnaaa!

 0790747324, A38ZTUNQJVGP6S, Michael Patrick Boyd, 0/0, 5.0, 1230854400, Time Travel, The Time Machine is one hour and forty-three minutes long and was released on August 17, 1960. The movie tells the story of an inventor named Herbert George Wells (George to his friends) who invents a time machine. George is unhappy in his own time and wants to travels to the future. The film starts in the present and George four friends are at his house waiting for him to arrive. George has left instructions to start dinner without him if he is not there at 8 pm. Just at the four guests are about to dine, George enters the room dirty and clothes torn. George begins the story five days ago when he shows them a prototype of a miniature time machine. When the four friends leave the house, George heads toward his lab and climb into the large scale model and heads into the feature. At first he starts off slowly the he begins to go faster and faster until he reaches October 12, 802,701. George lands in an almost paradise world. The only downside is that there are two different classes of people. The first class live on the land and are called the Eloi and they live simple life of no laws, government and civilization. They know nothing of their past and seems to be void of thought as well. The Elois speak in a childlike way. The second group of people is the Morlocks who live underground, operates the machinery, blue-skinned, and cannot stand the light. The Elois are basically cattle for the Morlocks. The Morlocks clothe, feed, and raise the Elois just to eat them when they are adults. George is appalled by all of this and tries to put this to an end. When George goes down a shaft to rescue Weena and the rest of the Elois and is able to blow up the shafts that the Morlocks can escape from. George eventually arrives five days later when he originally left from. His four friends do not believe his story, but David Filby seems to believe some of it. The Time Machine won an Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects (1961). The Time Machine is a great science fiction movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />VHS FEATURES<br />1) Theatrical Trailer<br />2) Time Machine: The Journey Back<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Play Movie<br />Scene Selections<br />Special Features<br />A) Cast & Crew<br />B) Time Machine: The Journey Back<br />C) Awards<br />D) Theatrical Trailer<br />Languages
 0790747324, A3II1ACACC5MTX, Pastor of Disaster, 0/0, 5.0, 1229040000, A little Time machine of its own..., When I was a kid, the Morlocks scared the hell out of me. I still love this film though, lets face it, it would be easy to make a monkeys arse of such a great story but the directors hand is firm, and the little touches that make this film so good are so enjoyable. The tailors dummy with the changing clothes, the spinning discs that provide the back story for the Eloi, its wonderful. My own childhood niggles such as the lack of interest of his colleagues and the lack of surprise of the Scots ginger-haired chap who meets him twice "in the future" annoyed me a little, but these are tiny glitches. Make no mistake, The Time Machine is a classic film and I hope one day my son will enjoy it as much as I did. Have to watch them Morlocks though!
 0790747324, A2KPOGTFS2AHWG, nekko50, 0/0, 5.0, 1223251200, A Enjoyable Journey, The movie is a timeless classic, just as I remembered from the first time I watched it a long, long time ago.

Alan Young plays Taylor's best friend and there are great behind-the-scenes stories for this movie in Young's book MISTER ED AND ME (I believe that is the title) also available on Amazon.com. If you love Morlocks, beautiful women, Oscar winning special effects and clever plots, this movie is for you.
 0790747324, A3EOYN87MMNHL1, Phoebe Stogstill, 0/0, 5.0, 1221177600, "Before its Time", I first viewed this film when I was 11 years old and I must confess that seeing this movie impacted my whole life.  I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors.  The time machine itself, is so humorous, but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption.  I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day.  My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life.  I consider this a much better movie than its "twin" Journey to the Center of the Earth, but they were both great and thought-provoking, especially to pre-teenagers. The scenes and special effects are phenomenal.  It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own.  Rod Taylor was not my favorite actor, but he did a very good job in this movie.
 0790747324, A3PJOERCZEQFI5, Chris M. "Cygnostik", 0/0, 4.0, 1209427200, Talk about classic, This really is a great movie in about every way.  It's well written & acted.  It has forsight. It's fun.  There are slow parts for people who can't appreciate the story and/or have a short attention span.  I have a hard time bringing myself to spend the time to re-watch it when I'm in the mood but when I do, I'm always glad I did.  I don't think any DVD collection is complete without this awesome classic.
 0790747324, A1L73PPUV3M6VU, elaine warren, 0/0, 5.0, 1209081600, A step back in time., The Time Machine is not only a wonderful movie but it is a favorite subject of mine; the ability to move back or forth through millions of years fascinates me, especially the future as it is largely unknown. For its age the film is scarcely dated with fine acting and production values, and one of those that you can watch over and over. The question of what to bring with you into another civilization for better or worse is infinitely intriguing.
 0790747324, A2HPYKC3S7DHZC, Rosalie Friedman "classic movie enthusiast", 0/0, 5.0, 1204588800, excellent!, I was very pleased with thr DVD "The Time Machine", mailed to me recently. It was in excellent condition and met my expectations. Thank you.

 0790747324, A1VDTPFDTVWMUY, Busy Granny "Mom", 0/0, 5.0, 1191369600, The Time Machine (Original), The movie is still as great as when it first came out years ago. The service was quick.
 0790747324, A1ZEWZG6AKB7C0, Moonstone7, 0/0, 4.0, 1188086400, One of the best, This was one of the scariest movies I had seen up until it came out in the 1960s as a child terrified that the A-bomb was going to drop any time I heard a fire alarm. When the Time Traveler gets to 1964 and the air raid sirens are going off, that was it for me. The movie was turned off! I didn't see it in its entirety until several years later and I outgrew (mostly) that fear.  I even got a copy of the book and read (most all of) it, for it, too, is a chilling tale of "what if."  I happened to watch the 2002 remake last night and it was OK, and entertaining. It definitely has flashier special effects. (How is it that Guy Pearce can outrun those CGI speed-induced Morlocks?)  Still, this one with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux is the granddaddy.  It won't disappoint.
 0790747324, A29Y3P1WQEXMXV, Jessiyari, 0/0, 4.0, 1120953600, Different yet still close to the book, First i'd like to say that although there are some differences between the movie and book.... i still loved it!<br /><br />Second... while i was reading some reviews (mostly the bad ones) the one that bothered me was that of 'davidfancella,' when says that the relationship between Weena and time traveler is man and pet, that was not how i viewed it in the novel, i did feel a romantic connection and i don't think i was the only one and everyone is entitled to their opinion and their interpretation and i did get a romantic feeling between them in the book.<br /><br />Yes in the book the Eloi were short and i was kind of disapointed that they were of average height here but that is my only complain.<br /><br />The ending was changed and i like this hollywood ending better only because in the book it left me wondering what happened to the time traveler and i wanted to know and this movie tells you what happened, but if you are the type that likes when writers leaves the ending up to the readers imagination then read the book, read the book anyways because i did enjoy it!<br /><br />I think the movie looked and sounded great, even if the evil creatures did look totally fake even if some things from the book were changed and left out. I think it was a great story, and a great cast and the roles were played out perfectly. Like i said, different yet from all the versions i've seen, this is the one closer to the book of the time traveler disapointed with the present who thought that the future was his answer and that humanity would progress only to be disapointed again when he sees how lazy and dumb society becomes. Really makes one think!
 0790747324, A30TK6U7DNS82R, Kevin Killian, 0/0, 5.0, 1118966400, Dark Allegory, THE TIME MACHINE tells the story of (Rod Taylor), an enterprising Victorian scientist who develops a way-back machine that crushes four dimensions into three, so that human beings can be transported through time as well as through space.  The excitement of Victorian discovery is well conveyed, and Rod Taylor, the Australian he-man star, does an excellent job of seeming as though he can think as well as heave his muscles around.  His first moments inside the machine are thrilling, as light changes into dark with a rapidity that astounds him, then light again, then dark, then whole months pass within instants, and then whole years.  When he gets to the future he finds that human beings have somehow bifurcated into two distinct races, the Morlocks a race of strong men who are stupid, the other brainiac weaklings.  Obviously there was a Cold War undercurrent in this George Pal production, and even when we were kids we read the thuggish Morlocks as Stalinist supermen, while the Eloi were us, castrated professors educated out of our balls.  Rod Taylor's mission is to re-insert some backbone into those pale pacifist Eloi and get them to fight back against the creatures of the night.  Yvette Mimieux is Weena, exquisitely elfin and needy, in her leaf-colored linen dress, falling for George (HG Wells, Rod Taylor's character) despite her natural antipathy towards dark men.<br /><br />This is one of the scariest movies ever made and yet, oddly enough, it is perfect for young children.  Maybe we all like to be frightened from time to time.  Funnily enough I hardly noticed the satirical messages in this movie when I was a little boy, all I knew was that I was scared of the Morlocks, pitied the Eloi, and identified with Rod Taylor and I wanted to be the one who would come sort out the mess of the whole world.  Towards the end of the film George is faced with a big dilemma-should he go back to the Victorian world or should he return to the world 1,000,000 years from now where Weena waits for him?<br /><br />It's a treat on DVD, as are the special features and commentary, but Alan Young doesn't seem to have a bit of shame in him; he should have apologized to the entire world for the dreadful Scottish accent he uses in the movie.
 0790747324, A3N9CZ1RK4OTYE, Douglas Keith McEwan, 0/0, 4.0, 1058140800, Fantasy Classic Forever, George Pal's classic movie is a delight from begining to end, and, surprisingly, much closer to Well's book than his great grandson's lame remake, with much creepier Morlocks. The documentary on the DVD is a mixed bag, with great stuff about what has become of the machine itself, it's rescue and restoration, and also odd stuff with Alan Young and Rod Taylor in a sequel scene that contradicts the movie. The  documentary is dedicated to the memories of George Pal and Mike Minor, the latter a friend of mine who is much missed. Skip the remake and enjoy the original.
 0790747324, A2SGR7LE899LGG, Luigi, 0/0, 5.0, 1053993600, A classic and a Masterpiece., I saw this movie when I was a kid and it stood with me ever since. I just love the film, the machine and the overall plot. It just keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know more as the movie unfold. The simple but yet clear scientifical explanation early on in the film is a great suspense setter. Overall: EXCELLENT.
 0790747324, A2ZSC81MXLBELX, L. Shirley "Laurie's Boomer Views", 134/135, 5.0, 1068249600, Go Back In Time With An Old Friend....., This review refers to the Warner Bros. DVD edition of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;(1960)......<p>I am so impressed with how this 43 year old classic Sci-Fi film looks and sounds on the DVD, that I am going to start with that this time. I wasn't expecting it to look as great as it did because the editorial review here gives it 3 out of 5 stars on both the picture and the sound. If you are a big fan of this film, or thinking of buying it as a gift for someone who is, you will not be disappointed with this transfer. The picture is presented in the original widescreen format,so you won't miss a bit of the action. To watch it you would think you went back in the time machine to 1960 and were viewing it for the first time. It is clear and sharp with vibrant color.The soundtrack is remastered in Dolby Dig 5.1 and is a welcome enhancement.The DVD also includes a terrific Behind The Scenes documentary called &quot;Time Machine...The Journey Back&quot;. The film's star Rod Taylor hosts and fans will love this informative feature. You'll get a good look at how the actual machine was made and the journey that it has taken in the last 40 years as well as other interesting tid bits. This feature has it's own scene selections to choose from or you can just watch it straight through. The film may be viewed in French and has subtitles in English and French.(my only teeny complaint would be that the black bar area is not used for these subtitles, they are at the bottom of the film).<p>The story based on the novel by H.G. Wells is as captivating today as it ever was. You know the tale.....<br />George(Rod Taylor)has all the time in the world. He tells his friends an incredible story of his adventures traveling through the ages in a time machine that he has built. As his story begins, he starts out slowly traveling through the 20th century. He doesn't like what he sees. War and destruction seem to be the fate of civilaztion.He pushes foward, quickly, and the years fly by. Finally stopping in the year 802701,he comes across what seems to be a paradise on earth. Clean air,fruit growing in abundance, and a society of young beautiful people, the Eloi, who don't seem to have a care in the world. But even in this Utopian like civilazation there's trouble amiss.The Morlocks are running things from underground and they are just as scary today as they ever were.So it's up to our guy George to save this future civilazation from the evil Morlocks,and try to get back home to the year 1900 for an 8pm dinner appointment..whew,what a great story!<p>Directed brillantly by George Pal(&quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;/&quot;Atlantis the Lost Continent&quot;), the film also boasts the great talents of Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, and the lovely Yvette Mimieux, as &quot;Weena&quot;, who adds a little romantic interest to the story. The film was awarded a well deserved Oscar for it's special effects(also discussed in the featurette) for Gene Warren and Tim Barr.The movie is rated G, although the scenes with the Morlocks might be a little scary for very young children.<p>A great story, fabulous film and an outstanding DVD. So go back in time, with your old friend &quot;The Time Machine&quot;..enjoy...Laurie
 0790747324, A25ZVI6RH1KA5L, cookieman108 "cookieman108", 76/78, 5.0, 1115942400, "When it comes to time, we are prisoners.", I wonder how many minds were blown back in the day when George Pal's The Time Machine (1960) was released?  I'm not so much speaking of the special effects (which were, and still are amazing), but more so the concepts presented within the film, with regards to traveling in the fourth dimension i.e. moving back and forth through time all while occupying the same space throughout...I know, I know, the ideas had been around for some time as author H.G. Wells had created the work the film was based on way back around the turn of the 20th century, but surely the film reached a large audience, quite a few probably never having read his novel.  Produced and directed by George Pal (When Worlds Collide, The War of the Worlds), a pioneer in fantasy and sci-fi cinema, the film stars Rod Taylor (World Without End, The Birds), in what is probably his best-known role as George, a scientist with a hankering to break on through to the other side.  Also appearing is Alan Young, whom many may recognize as the voice for Disney's Scrooge McDuck (he also was the only actor from the original film to appear in the recent 2002 remake starring Guy Pearce), Yvette Mimieux (Where the Boys Are, The Black Hole), Tom Helmore (Vertigo), Whit Bissell (Airport, Soylent Green), and Sebastian Cabot (Kismet), whom many may remember as the rotund Mr. French from the late 60's television show `Family Affair'.<br /><br />The story begins in Victorian England with the arrival of a group of distinguished looking gentlemen to the home of their colleague George, played Rod Taylor.  Thing is, George invited them for dinner, but has yet to appear himself, that is until he busts through the door, disheveled and unkempt, with what may be the most fantastic tale any one has ever heard, which takes us back five days prior as George, who's an inventor by the way, is having the same group over to reveal his latest invention, a machine that would allow for one to travel backwards and forwards through time.  It's all theoretical as the device has yet to be tested, and George is met with skepticism by all except for one, his friend Filby (Young).  Anyway, after the guests leave, George decides it's time to put his machine to the test, and what do you know?  It Works!  One should know the impetus for George's desire to travel forward in time is based on his dissatisfaction with the current state of human development, specifically out penchant for fighting with each other, and he desires to see a world without conflict, among other things.  As he goes forward he stops a few times but that which he wishes to avoid continually presents itself, eventually driving him into the year 800,000 where the world has become an Eden-like paradise populated by people called the Eloi.  There is no need to work, no laws, no gooberment, just a carefree lifestyle...with a hideous underbelly in the form of a group called the Morlocks, grotesque underground dwellers who are, well, what they are and share a chilling relationship with the Eloi...<br /><br />I found this film to be great fun, and one of the best science fictions films I've seen in a long time.  As far as its faithfulness to the source material, I couldn't really tell you, but I did get the feel that there was a lot of respect involved towards Wells' vision, especially given the film focused a great deal on the moral aspects and implications of who we are and how they may affect future generations.  This, along with superior special effects (which earned the film an Academy Award for 1960) really helped sell the film overall.  Some of the effects may seem quaint by today's standards, but back in the day this had to have been cutting edge stuff.  The passage of time indicated by all the meticulous stop motion work, among other things, looks amazing.  I also really liked the whole `Victorian' feel of the time machine itself, a sense that it was truly created within the time period specified.  I thought Taylor did very well presenting a man driven by his desire to find the best in humanity, only to discover the more things change, the more they tend to stay the same.  It felt like there was real growth from within the character, growth that stemmed from experiencing so much in so little time.  I especially liked the character of Alan Young as Filby as to me he represented sort of the general populous of society, those who live their lives day to day, living within their world, content to make things better through small steps than great strides.  I can't remember the specific dialog, but there was a scene that illustrated this well in where Filby tries to convince George to destroy his machine and makes a remark with regards to how we have to live within our time and make the best of it that we can...<br /><br />Warner Brothers provides an excellent wide screen (1.66:1) transfer on this DVD.  The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the picture quality nearly flawless.  The audio, available in both English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0), comes through clean and clear.  There are some special features, including a theatrical trailer and cast and crew bios.  Also included is a 47 minute documentary that looks like it was made for television broadcast as there's obvious stopping points for the inclusion of commercials.  The piece, titled The Time Machine: The Journey Back, is hosted by the star of the original film Rod Taylor (looking much older), and offers a lot of details about the film, but the main focus seems to be on the machine itself, how it was developed, created, and its long and curious history after production on the original film ceased.  This takes up most of the 47 minute running time, with what is left used to create a sort of reunion tale as some of the original actors resume their character roles for a short bit.  I found this extra to be really interesting, and it helped me to appreciate the film even more, but I did feel it got a little schmaltzy (even creepy) at times, especially when Taylor would look up in the air and speak like he was talking to producer and director George Pal, who passed away in 1980, and I think this featurette was shot in 1993.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />Oh, in case you're interested, there is no formal seating in the future, only throw pillows, so if you ever get a chance to travel forward in time, BYOC (bring your own chair)...
 0790747324, A1BWHXTFOVF9CY, Blackhawk, 60/62, 5.0, 970963200, The Time Machine DVD Delivers, Like most people, I had only seen this classic science fiction movie on television.  That never detracted from the story, which is one of the best that Wells wrote, but it didn't prepare me for how great this movie looks and sounds.  The DVD provides brilliant color and a generally sharp picture with only a little, infrequent  softness that I suspect is from the original film.  I was surprised at how clean the transfer is.  I did not see any scratches, dust or other defects.  The movie is presented in its original, widescreen aspect ratio.  The sound is also excellent.  It has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and it is an excellent job for a movie that is forty years old.  As you would expect from such an old sound track, most of the action is in the center and front channels, but it uses the rear channels (especially noticable in key scenes, as when Rod Taylor is making echoes in the ruined dome building) and the subwoofer kicked in a few times, also.  The disc provides more extras than you would expect from a Warner release of an old movie.  It includes a trailer, filmographies for the three lead actors and George Pal, and a very good behind-the-scenes documentary.  The documentary was produced by Bob Burns 32 years after the making of the movie and focuses on the important part the time machine prop played in the making of the movie and it's history since, with an interesting account of how Burns found and then restored the original prop.  The documentary also features a scene in which Rod Taylor and Alan Young recreate their characters from the movie, acting out a scene that might have appeared in the movie but did not.  The scene uses the restored time machine prop to good effect and it was rather touching to see these much older actors slip so comfortably into their roles.  You could tell that this movie had been one of the high points of their careers and they remembered it fondly.  Likewise, Whit Bissel recreates his character in a short monologue full of a sense of nostalgia.  This old documentary was much more informative and interesting than a lot of the publicity puff pieces included on more recent films as extras. I highly recommend this DVD.  It delivers far more than I ever expected and does this classic movie justice.
 0790747324, A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ, Zoe Paris, 3/5, 4.0, 1163808000, If you like old movies....., I saw this as a kid when I was at my grandma's house and I really enjoyed it. I have watched it again as an adult and still find it to be just as entertaining. It's about a man who builds a time machine and goes into the future. He finds humans and a mutant cannibalistic breed of humans who live underground and eat normal humans. He meets a very pretty woman named Weena and they and the others must confront the monsters. It has a great ending and though the special effects are VERY dated, it's still really cool to see the time-lapse effect as he travels through the centuries. The movie is squeaky clean, has little kissing, mild action and is ok for most kids. It's a little scary in some parts but the monsters look so cheesy it's sort of funny. I find it really interesting to watch movies that my parents and grandparents saw. I think this movie is a classic and will be enjoyed for many more generations.
 0790747324, A16CZRQL23NOIW, Hiram Gomez Pardo, 3/5, 5.0, 1154476800, In search of a promissory future: the great illusion of the progress!, Based on the famous novel of H. G.

But this somber gaze has nothing to do with a promissory future where harmony and peace will reign.<br /><br />Regardless the spanning years, the film still strike you.

 0790747324, A24FSR37TN4MSF, Christine L. Tuohy, 3/5, 5.0, 1020038400, DVD version will blow your mind!, I've had the Time Machine on VHS forever it seems. Taped it off the TV years ago. But when I saw this DVD, it blew me away! I had NO IDEA! Never have I seen every colour in his jacket, every grain of dirt, every hair on his head with such clarity. The time machine absolutely shines with beauty too. I sat with my jaw hanging open and goose bumps on my arms even as soon as the opening credits when I heard the surround sound kick in. My VHS copy always had a really bad audio track, but on the DVD, you can actually hear the faint electrical buzz of the machine running in the lab before he hits that crystal lever. I saw and heard things I never knew existed in this movie.  And it has a fabulous documentary with it, hosted by Rod Taylor, that explains everything we always wondered like what happened to that little model of the machine that he put the cigar in, and the full scale machine itself has a story that you won't believe! All in all, it's a wonderful movie, and everything a DVD should be. Brilliant, vibrant, with gut vibrating audio. (and still better than the remake that was just in theatres) Fantastic!

 0790747324, A193A7T1E8CUTB, John F. Frederick, 3/5, 5.0, 1141603200, 'I'm going back to my own time.  I won't even bother to tell of the useless struggles of a hopeless future!', Though the film has flaws, mostly on the corney side, I think it is safe to say that this is the best adaptation of one of H.G. Wells' novels to film yet produced.<br /><br />Wells imaginatively projected the "class struggle" pondered by Marx (of the capitalist owners vs. workers without a share in the means of production) 800,000 years into the future.  In this way, combining with Darwinian evolution, it becomes a struggle between two sub-species: the underground machine-lord cannibal "Morlocks" vs. the above ground, sunshine-loving "Eloi," who the Morlocks simply breed as cattle.  In Wells' fancy, the differences between classes will become so extreme (assuming the absence of an earlier, political solution), there will eventually be an ironic ambiguity as to which class is really which.<br /><br />To its merit, this is evident enough in the film; but the film adds to that a couple of dated (innaccurate) predictions concerning the "near" future (now past).  The result is a risky and somewhat corney ride.  Yet this addition is also fairly well off-set by the fact that the time traveller is allowed to start his journey from the late 19th century (and so from Wells' own time, as in the novel). The film here has a vivid, added dimesion of the curiosity of a time machine starting its career before high tech--evidently by the sheer genius of a lone inventor. (This device was used by subsequent time travel films--as well as by other Wells-to-film attempts, like The First Men in the Moon, but never as effectively.) In the end, the film successfully portrays a maverick and human hero (the time traveller, who is never quite at home in and so rises above any period of time)--one who the audience is at least allowed to hope for--without in any way compromising the scope of Wells' intent.<br /><br />Perhaps it is even some return trip of the time traveller to those "horse and buggy" days which changes the innacurate "predictions" to recent history as we actually know it--a possibility plainly allowed for (though not shouted out) by the screenplay. A question for familiar viewers--would Filby really just let his son Jamie die and his store be destoyed, for apparently no good reason--after having received due warning?<br /><br />The time-lapse photography for the time travel scenes are put to very good use. The visual appearance of the machine in the film, extrapolated from Wells' descriptions, is a remarkable feat of imagination and ingenuity, and is the envy of every true sci-fi buff.  A scene where the time traveller takes a moment to gaze upon and walk about his creation before embarking on his first journey, looking on it with admiration, amazement and anticipation (as if the machine itself were a discovery more than an invention, seamlessly pregnant with the endless adventures it promises), is even breathtaking.<br /><br />The Hollywood swashbuckling and boy-meets-girl aspects are present but not overblown. The wonder of time meets technology is intelligently dealt with, as is the wonder of a man who steps out of his own time. In this respect it is very fun to watch the time traveller try to kindle the spark of curiosity and wonder in the spiritually deadened descendents of the future, who are plainly depicted as having their forerunners stemming back as far as the late 1800's (the time traveller having had similar trouble at that time as well, trying to wake up closed-minded friends and aquaintances as he argues with them about the value of time-travel). The near-futility of his stuggle is very forceful, vivid and effective.<br /><br />The casting is flawless and the acting is excellent, especially for the two main characters, the unnamed by Wells, "Time Traveler" (though very subtly given the cameo name in the film of H. George Wells--the first initial H. followed by "George Wells" only briefly appearing in shots of the time machine's control panel, where the inventor stylistically ingraved it--though his friends do call him George) and his tiny, delicate and fun-loving girlfriend from the future, Weena.<br /><br />Incidentally, the 2002 Dreamworks remake is good, but really has nothing to do with Wells' novel.  One nice twist is the albino and articulate Morlock. Weena is still pretty, but has nothing to do with Wells' novel--even her name gets changed to "Mara." The time machine itself is also good (very good), though it is impossible to believe it was constructed in 1899.  Not so for the 1960 film; I believe it every time--"If someone had made a time machine in 1899 that somehow actually worked, that is what it would have looked like."  Overall, in terms of sets and direction in the "remake," the distant future does not appear as distant and exotic as in the earlier film. Distorted beyond recognition in the 2002 remake is the foreboding, silent future image of the Sphinx, towering over the time traveller when he first arrives in the year 802,701.  This image from the novel is present in 1960 film, and is intended to invoke the tantalizing theme of "the riddle of the Sphinx"--what is the difference between man and beast?  Yet in this remake there are few mysteries.  Overall, the film has the same failings, while at the same time being "maverick" gets reduced to the mundane, like wearing a hat not yet in style. Notably absent is the nearly-futile and perennial struggle of the hero.<br /><br />Does the 1960 version solve the riddle of the Sphinx?  I think it hints at a solution: at the end of the movie, the housekeeper, Mrs. Watchett (evidently a widow, but not evidently without children), befriending Filby, evidently wishes to keep the house light going in at least in one window (in case of the Time Traveller's return)--as such she also evidently represents the future Eloi; the scene is shot just as we must imagine that Weena is also awaiting the Time Traveller's return.  It is his businessmen friends who become the Morlock--though Filby is the ambiguous go between.

 0790747324, AF6894EAENX11, J. Valadez "joe v", 1/2, 4.0, 1265846400, Above average entertainment, I saw this movie on tv when I was a child.  It made a big impression on me.  I saw it again as an adult and realized it had even more to offer in the way of concepts (above and beyond the special effects).  I know this movie was remade.  I saw the remake, I can't remember very much about it, it was unremarkable.<br /><br />But this version was intriguing, and thought provoking and has cool special effects.  I shared it with my grandson for the first time.  He's 10 years old and jaded by Modern Warefare II type graphics, but he still appreciated this movie.  It has special effects, it has a story, and it sticks in your mind.  What else could you ask for?
 0790747324, A1LS8REVM1FGCX, Ma Magdalena Lozano, 1/2, 5.0, 1258761600, great classic movie, This is a good fantasy movie. Rod Taylor is terrific in his role as is Yvette Mimeux. If you want action and adventure, this is the movie for you.

 0790747324, A2QP12447GKEDU, Third Grade Teacher, 1/2, 5.0, 1243209600, Travel in Time with HG Wells, Several 3rd grade classes in my school viewed this movie (rated G)after reading a version of the book.  We'd read it chapter by chapter and reviewed with EOG-style questions.  Wow-talk about a page-turner!  The children could not wait to read the next chapter just as soon as we finished the last.  Watching the movie was a fun way to see the images we'd created in our minds come to life.  This was the original version (I think the best) and because it is rated G, I felt very comfortable showing it to my students.
 0790747324, ACGNP00TEIEV3, Pat Dewees, 1/2, 5.0, 1243036800, An unexpected vision of the future, The chronological setting of the movie is New Year's Eve 1899.  George Wells (named in honor or the author of the original book) is just hours from seeing another century.  But he is not satisfied with that, nor does he have to be.  He wants to go many centuries into the future.<br /><br />The H.G. Wells book this movie is based on was written in 1895 close to when this movie is set.  It was also the first story of time travel by mechanical means.  "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" written by Mark Twain six years beforehand was about time travel via a bump on the head.  In fact it was this book that coined the phrase "time machine."<br /><br />The movie closely follows the book except that it takes advantage of knowledge of 20th Century history not available to writers in the 1890's.  When traveling into the future George stops during the two World Wars and the year 1966 which was a future year when this movie was made.  Then he narrowly escapes a nuclear blast.  This encases him and his machine in rock forcing him to continue traveling into the future until the rock was worn away over time.  He stops in the year 802,701.<br /><br />George expects to see new inventions and progress.  He is shown some advanced technology but not much.  What he first sees is a lush garden and people, all blond and young, living in leisure.  It appears that mankind has found a way back to the Garden of Eden.  But something is just not right.  For starters they do nothing when one of them is drowning in the river.  The time traveler rescues the woman whose name is Weena and asks about her people's "rather curious attitude."<br /><br /> He finds out more about these people.  They are called the Eloi.  There are people underground called the Morlock.  But they do not look anything like the Eloi.  These Morlocks are blue skinned, big eyed, monstrous looking people.  Over time the human race has divided into two species.  The Eloi have everything provided to them by the Morlocks but they pay a price for it.  They all must eventually go underground to be eaten by the Morlocks.  They respond to a siren with the exact same sound that civil defense sirens have been sounding since the beginning of the 20th Century.  The time traveler had heard this sound during his stop in a World War II air raid and in the 1966 nuclear holocaust as people were being warned to seek shelter.  Apparently people had been so conditioned to respond to that sound by going underground that the Eloi were doing so mindlessly.<br /><br />H.G. Wells was concerned about the working class increasingly working underground.  In this story, this perceived trend of his has progressed to an extreme.  There is a lot more to this story than someone going into the future and seeing new gadgets.  On top of being a fun movie, it is rich in social commentary.  The movie gives one the experience of traveling with the main character.

 0790747324, A20EEWWSFMZ1PN, bernie "webviator", 1/2, 5.0, 1168732800, I want one of them there machines!, This is the story of George "H.G. Wells" (Rod Taylor) who is an inventor. He has invited his friends to a dinner and is inexcusably late. Staggering in all disheveled he is asked what happened to him. So he relays the story.<br /><br />A week earlier it was the turn of the century. He was showing his latest invention "The Time Machine." With this machine he could go into the future or the past. Being an optimist about mans future he chose the future. The adventure begins.<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is the definitive time machine movie. There have been others before and others after "Time After Time" (1979). There has been time without machines "Somewhere in Time"(1980). But just as Cecil's "The Ten Commandments" (1956) is the version you remember.<br /><br />There are other remakes or versions of this story made later. The (1978) TV version which did a fair job of portraying the book even if it looked like a TV movie; Priscilla Barnes played Weena.  An earlier make of the movie (1949) Mary Donn played Weena. Then they forgot how to make movies and went to today's sound bit razzle-dazzle shallow version (2002) hopefully not the last attempt, looks like Weena is out too.<br /><br />Rod Taylor's time machine is the one that you remember. An interesting side note is that in the book "The Time Machine" by H. G. Wells, Weena was not much worth messing around with and defiantly did not look like Yvette Mimieux.<br /><br />Later in the story mankind breaks into two species. The interesting part is that in the book the reason was social. In this movie it is war and the A-bomb. In future movies it is eugenics. Given today's climate it will probably be social again.<br /><br />Any way I want the fancy time machine and a Morlock suit.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K9O7">The Sticky Fingers of Time</a>
 0790747324, A15N5W09G9KLBU, J. Keefer "dude-cicle", 1/2, 5.0, 1120608000, When Sci-fi actually interested me, This film was made before CG, before Star Wars and Star Trek and all those other sci-fi films that seem to be wholly about lasers and do-dads and weird looking aliens.  See, I never liked science fiction.  I found it to be too nerdy, lacking heart and soul, more concerned with gadgetry and amazingly complicated story lines and stuff I just couldn't relate to.  What I didn't realize is that there is sci-fi for me: the classics.  This was when the emphasis was on the fiction, this was when sci-fi could serve as an allegory to man's plight in the universe, peeling back the layers of what makes us human while carefully masking it's message behind some entertainment.  The time machine is one of these films.  I first saw it in sixth grade, many years ago and remembered being surprised about liking it (again, don't like sci-fi).  But this film has some great characters, performances, something to say without saying it, and some great old effects (again, cg takes me right out of a film, it's just more inventive here if a bit cheesy).  THe picture looks great so I'd definately recommend buying it.<br /><br />But the real reason to buy it is the behind the scenes featurette. It is simply hillarious.  I have never laughed so hard at a featurette.  The pacing is what got to me, the singular fixation on the prop of the time machine rather than an in-depth explanation of the film, the creepy way Rod Taylor looks up to talk to the deceased George Pal, when one of the actors just stares into the camera talking to the audience in character with a slow zoom into his face, the "what-if" scene at the end, the random inclusion of material and the shoving in of the title card every once and awhile.  It's like listening to your grandfather tell you a story about his favorite chair.  It's comic genius (not to be disrespectful to any involved but all seemed highly staged and organized so I feel that I'm not insulting them when I say that)<br /><br />Favorite line: Rod Taylor: "And so the time machine lives on, in Back to the Future promos and other various appearences"<br /><br />Trust me, this thing is genius.  It's like Christopher Guest on his best day.
 0790747324, AIOXMENE1HBR7, GreatMovieCriticRobertfromUS, 1/2, 5.0, 1089072000, The Time Machine still a timeless classic, Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux star in George Pal's &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, a great sci fi movie based on the novel by H.G. Wells.<p>Taylor plays George an inventor in the late 18th century (1899 to be exact) who makes a machine that can go back in time.<p>At first his colleagues are skeptical, but when they see George's small model machine that goes back in time, they start to believe him.<p>George's best friend, and supporter is David played by Alan Young.<p>George takes the machine back, because he is sick of the present time, with war being brought on.<p>He travels to the early and middle 1900's and to his shock , George finds out that Man's future lies in war (which is pretty accurate even up to today's time).<p>He sees how WWI and WWII started, and even sees when his house is destroyed by an enemy plane!<p>George then travels far into the future, the year 802701, to see if mankind has any hope of living in peace.<p>At first, he sees a great paradise with many people (mostly children) play about in solitude. But when one lady named Weena, starts to drown, he sees that no one seems to care. He rescues her, and after talking to the other youths, he learns that they learned nothing from their ancient ancestors.<p>The books they have are old and buried.<p>They have lived the good the life, based on the sacrifices from mankind, and they don't appreciate it (which is another accurate telling of today's times).<p>He learns that Weena is part of the Eloi society which is under the slavery of the Morlocks, a cannibalistic race.<p>The Morlocks give everything, food and clothing to the Eloi , in exchange for the slavery and their bodies as food.<p>The movie was directed by sci fi whiz George Pal who won an impressive 7 oscars and awards for his movies.<p>He is the Steven Spielberg when it comes to sci fi movies.<p>What's astonishing about the film is the special effects that were made without computer help (which in most movies make the movie look more fake than real).<p>The way the special effects people made flowers bloom, candles burn while the Time Machine went in time, is very special to see.<p>It's a great site, from a special effects view, how these people managed to do these effects, with the limited resources they had.<p>He directed &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Destination Moon&quot; which won numerous awards. DVD comes with a number of great features:<p>A behind the scenes documentary with Rod Taylor. A great documentary where he shows how George Pal designed the machine. Taylor even shows us storyboards which haven't been seen in 30 yrs.<p>Even the DVD main menu with Taylor on the cover and the Murlocks in the background, give the DVD a great sci fi look!!
 0790747324, A3160YSU1KRL8E, Michael Ziegler, 1/2, 5.0, 1088812800, From 1899 to 802,701 AD The &quot;Timeless&quot; Classic, There are a lot of reviews about this great picture and how it influenced an entire generation. All of it is true! For some reason this film ties into the imagination and fills you with wonder. We can thank Mr. Wells for creating the story, but we really owe it to George Pal, Wah Chang and Gene Warren for translating the book into a miracle of romantic adventure. The real draw of course is &quot;The Time Machine&quot; prop. Never in the history of film has a prop been more imitated and desired. The special effects received an Academy Award and it was well deserved. All of the elements of Victorian London in winter, cozy parlors surrounded with friends gathered for dinner, &quot;tea table&quot; chat over the 4th dimension and the recollection of an experiment in time travel utilizing a flashback technique are what makes this film so enchanting. When Rod Taylor finally begins a slow initial journey we see the sky in motion in day and night sequences that are breathtaking in astronomic splendor. As the flowered garden and fruit trees go through their seasonal cycles in rapid progression you cannot help but be drawn into the wonder of creation and the genius of invention! The screenwriters then play with your imagination as we see our traveler stop at different events in our 20th century past and a &quot;cold war&quot; interpretation of the decade in which it was filmed when he stops in the &quot;future&quot; on August 18th, 1966 to witness a nuclear holocaust. From here we are quickly transported to the focal point of the Wells story to a future society of Eloi and Morlock culture. The care that went into this DVD should not be understated. It is a highly polished film that restores 20/20 vision to the frames so that we can see all of the colorful beauty that was originally there. Once again, we can SEE the atomic satellite zeroing in, the clear sky above the Eloi &quot;cafeteria&quot; and the smoking machinery of the Morlock caverns. When our traveler returns to 1899 and presents the flower to Filby that was given to him by Weena you will agree that &quot;that flower could not have possibly bloomed in the winter time&quot; and in the holding of that flower you will realize that this is a magic moment in film that will be with you forever and as Mrs. Watchit gradually turns off the lights in our view from the snowy evening outside you will think about the three books you would have taken and agree that having seen this film you will never be the same again, because you are in love with a romantic idea, TIME TRAVEL.
 0790747324, A2RRCZLVCA7A7, Katie Stuart, 1/2, 4.0, 1085097600, Review for &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, The Time Machine had a great effect on me. I found it to be enjoyable and it had very fascinating theories throughout. What I liked most in the book was the interesting characters, H.G. Wells' style of writing, the parallel of Eloi and Morlocks to society now, how the book always kept my attention, and finally I liked how the narrator left us questioning the conclusion of the novel.<br />  First, I liked how interesting the characters were simply because that is a vital aspect to a good novel. I was impressed by the Time Traveller, and how he was determined to prove his machine to be a success. The characters whom attended his dinners always seemed a little skeptical of his ideas and theories. The Time Traveller explains his discovery of the fourth-dimension and the Psychologist interrupts stating,&quot;You can move about in all directions of space, but you cannot move about in Time&quot; (III.13.16).<br />  The second thing I liked about the novel was the authors' style of writing. Wells remained descriptive throughout the book. For a novel based on imagination and theories, I found it important that Wells had kept some reality in it. (Reality being the descriptive details in the novel.) With all these crazy ideas going on in the book, Wells had to keep our minds somewhat intact to what his visions were. The Time Traveller describes the Eloi's as being &quot;very beautiful and graceful creatures, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive-that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much&quot;(III.34.33.)<br />  Another aspect of the novel I enjoyed, was the parallel of the Eloi and Morlocks to society now. We begin to understand that the Eloi and Morlocks are humans after great evolution and time. It amazed me to see how society completely divided itself between graceful creatures and creatures of the underworld.<br />  The fourth thing I liked was how the book kept my attention the whole way through. I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next or how the Time Traveller was going to escape the Morlocks and get back to his machine.<br />  Finally, I really enjoyed how the narrator concludes the Time Travellers disappearance. The narrator says,&quot;The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned&quot;(XII.124.18). I liked this because it made you question whether the Time Traveller had vanished into the future forever, whether he had always been from a past time and had gone back, or what was to come of him? So, as it began with one mans' imagination, it ends with your own.

The case was damaged inside and a piece of the plastic was rubbing on the recorded side od the DVD making scratches all over. The quality of the video was then, of course, damaged also. Lesson: check before you ship. I'll reorder it, probably from a different supplier.
 0790747324, A11XQIT4N5TC8S, Johnsie44, 0/1, 5.0, 1322956800, A real classic, I first saw this movie when I was a young chap. The time travel concept greatly appealed to me then (you have to appreciate the standard of sci-fi movies of the time) and still holds a nostalgic charm for me today at sixty-seven years old. Yea! It has been beautifully restored and looks just like it did back then. (maybe even better). Gorgeous period feel. The machine is magnificent and Rod is the mans' man. I'm not too sure about the special features, a bit hammy and unnecessary, although the machine's reclamation was interesting and the special effects techniques fascinating. I may be a bit of geek, but this DVD is one of my all-time sci fi favorites.

 0790747324, A22U5T9Q0GI5GV, Bill Bickley "Brown Dirt Cowboy", 0/1, 5.0, 1314921600, Outstanding George Pal Special Effects., I read this book when I was a child and have always loved the story.  This film version is a very good retelling of the H.G. Wells Classic tale.  Rod Taylor does a very good job as the Time Traveler (who in the novel is unnamed, but is called George in the film), and a young, beautiful Yvette Mimieux is well-cast as Weena the child-like woman of the far distant future.  The Special Effects done by George Pal demonstrate his usual excellent work.  They are a little dated, but taking into consideration that the film was made in the early 1960's they are outstanding for the time.  The Morlocks look a little cheesy, but if one ignores these minor details, the film is a real treat.  After seeing this film countless times, I am thrilled to be able to share it with my grandchildren.  This film stays more or less true to the book by H.G. Wells and is a classic just like the book.  I am sure that Sci-Fi fans like myself will enjoy this film.  It is definitely worth the five star rating that I gave it.

The quality of the image is much better & more clear. It's the same original movie but even more enjoyable to watch now. The DVD I received is perfect quality for a used movie. I highly recommend used movies from Amazon. They are great to replace older movies on VCR tape. The prices are very good.

He finds himself in a devolved world, where humans (the eloi) are mere cattle, living in ignorant bliss. They are food for the race of subterranean mutants (morlocks) that lord over them. Can Taylor's character help these doomed folks? Classic stuff!...

I wished that they would have made Time Machine II.  They had a script for the film but was never produced.  This one is better than the one that was remade in 2002.

 0790747324, A17U4YXN5G7UAP, Vicki L., 0/1, 4.0, 1085443200, Very good film, Excellent acting by Taylor, Young, Cabot, and Mimieux (sp?). Good sets and fine (if now outdated story). To reviewer Michael Butts. Giant was directed by George Stevens, not George Pal.
 0790747324, A3LZGLA88K0LA0, Michael Butts, 0/1, 5.0, 1084665600, TAYLOR MADE CLASSIC, Director George Pal will probably be more remembered for this film than any of his other classics, including &quot;Giant.&quot;  Why?  Remember, this is 1960, and whether or not Pal's version is true to Wells' book is not the issue.  Marvel at the unique special effects, including the mannequin's many transformations, the way the clouds scurry across the window; the lush but sterile world of the eloi and morlocks.  This is quite groundbreaking in the world of cinema, long before the CGI and animatronics guys came along.  Rod Taylor (The Birds, TV's Falcon Crest) is the perfect studly hero, but he also possesses a sensitivity uncommon in movies of the 60s, which is all more evident in his friendship with the delightful Alan Young (Tom Thumb, Mr. Ed).  Add a trio of our most respected character actors (Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissell and Tom Helmore) to lend upper crust credence.  And how can one forget the lovely Yvette Mimieux.  Yvette came to audiences attentions in a two part Dr. Kildare episode. She played his love interest, a surfer with elilepsy, who dies in the final moments.  She also played the troubled young girl in &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; and in the 1970s starred in a rarely known cult classic, &quot;Hit Lady.&quot;  Her beautiful innocence is captured in this movie.<br />Yes, it's campy, a little corny in its naivete about man's future, but as a scifi film, it's one of the best and far surpasses its glitzy remake with Guy Pearce.

 0790747324, A3RRBPUGD7UOSP, chemikalguy "chemikalguy", 0/2, 5.0, 1022630400, Classic Science Fiction, This is the ultimate in classic sci-fi. Even though the special effects pale in comparison to today's standards, I like it better than the remake.<br /><br />This is the story of H.G. Wells, told as a recounting of his visit nearly a million years into the future in a time machine he has constructed. The film differs from the book in a few ways, but they are mostly because the original book was written long before the creation of the atomic bomb, and that in the 50's when the film was made, everyone was paranoid of nuclear attack.<br /><br />The DVD version has some great behind the scenes and 'making of' featurettes. If you are a fan of classic sci-fi, this is a must-have.<br /><br />At the end of the film, Wells goes back to the future time, and the only thing that he appears to have taken are visible as two empty spaces on his bookshelf. The question is, which two books would you take?

 0790747324, A27QZDO1FRRFCV, Tyler Liermann, 1/5, 4.0, 1030838400, Decent, nothing new from the DVD to VHS., Unlike the recent re-make this flows more of the book diologe....<br />  I give it good acting credit, Alough I think it does kinda lack the classic touch but it was the good classic tech (not the best but good) Ide suggest renting it, buy it if you relly like it!.

 0790747324, A1Y6LC4JFBCGZN, Michael Butkus, 8/8, 4.0, 924480000, Time-less classic sci-fi that bears up to repeated viewing., Although quite different in tone and content from the original novel by H.G. Wells, George Pal's Oscar winner for Special Effects,The Time Machine convincingly conveys the wonder and mystery of time travel. Rod Taylor's  highly believable and intense portrayal of the time traveler is a major  strength of the film. Even though the special effects are &quot;dated&quot;  and reveal at times the &quot;effects&quot; of low budget, they manage to  hold up over repeated viewings much like Pal's The War of the Worlds.
